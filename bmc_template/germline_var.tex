\parttitle{Background} %if any
The tumour genome contains germline information that may have clinical implications for patients and their families. Therefore, clinical laboratories must be equipped to confirm potential germline variants identified by routine tumour sequencing through downstream germline testing. The most common source of DNA in clinical laboratories is formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. However, fixation with formalin is known to cause DNA fragmentation and sequence artifacts that impose technical challenges in DNA sequencing.

Using amplicon sequencing data from FFPE tumours with matched blood specimens, we compared efficiency of amplicon generation and sequencing results between specimen types to characterize formalin-induced DNA damages. We determined the true positive rate of detecting germline variants in FFPE tumours by assessing the concordance of germline variants between blood and FFPE specimens. We also compared sensitivity of germline variant calling in FFPE tumours to blood at various variant allele frequency thresholds and established a cut-off to achieve high positive predictive value for referral of potential germline variants for confirmatory germline testing without compromising sensitivity of detection.

\section*{Background}

The application of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies for tumour profiling has been increasingly integrated into oncologic care to detect targetable somatic mutations and personalize treatments for cancer patients. Although analysis of tumour-normal paired samples is required to accurately discriminate between somatic and germline variants, most clinical laboratories only sequence tumour samples to minimize cost and turnaround time \cite{Raymond2016}. However, genomic analyses of tumours can also reveal secondary genomic findings, which are germline information that may have clinical implications for patients and their family members \cite{Raymond2016}. In fact, several studies demonstrated that a germline cancer-predisposing variant is present in 3-10\% of patients undergoing tumour-normal sequencing \cite{Raymond2016,Meric-Bernstam2016,Schrader2015,Jones2015}. Therefore, clinical laboratories providing tumour genomic testing must be equipped to perform germline confirmatory testing on potential germline variants or be prepared to refer such cases to external services.

Because the tumour genome contains germline information, clinical laboratories can leverage tumour genomic testing to perform initial screening for clinically relevant germline variants such as variants in pharmacogenomic (PGx) genes. Subsequently, a similar framework for validating secondary germline findings can be applied, in which only patients with potential germline PGx variants are subjected to downstream germline testing. This procedure for germline PGx testing is more cost-effective because it does not require processing, sequencing, and analysis of normal DNA for every patient. The ability to implement germline PGx testing at a reduced cost can significantly benefit patient care because these variants cause functional changes in drug targets and drug disposition proteins (proteins involved in drug metabolism and transport), thereby contributing to inter-patient differences in chemotherapeutic response \cite{McLeod2013}. Hence, such genomic information can be used to guide the selection of chemotherapeutic drugs and optimization of drug dosage for cancer patients, leading to improved safety and efficacy of treatment and reduced risk of toxicity \cite{McLeod2013}.

Detection of genomic alterations in tumour DNA is also faced with technical challenges conferred by formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour specimens \cite{Do2015,Wong2014}. Tumour biopsies are often formalin-fixed to preserve tissue morphology for histological examination and to enable storage at room temperature; however, formalin fixation causes DNA fragmentation and base modifications, which pose difficulties in using DNA extracted from FFPE tumours for clinical genomic testing \cite{Do2015,Wong2014}. Fragmentation damage caused by formalin fixation leads to reduced template DNA for PCR amplification, thereby affecting the efficiency of amplicon-based NGS testing \cite{Do2015,Wong2014}. Furthermore, the degree of DNA fragmentation was shown to be higher in tissues from older FFPE blocks and tissues fixed with formalin of lower pH \cite{Do2015}. Formalin fixation is also problematic because it gives rise to depurination, which generates abasic sites, and cytosine deamination resulting in C$>$T/G$>$A transitions \cite{Do2015}. These forms of formalin-induced DNA damage contribute to the presence of sequence artifacts in FFPE specimens, which can be inaccurately identified as real genomic alterations.

In this study, we assessed the concordance of germline PGx variants between tumour and matched normal DNA by analyzing amplicon-based targeted NGS data from 213 patients with tumour-normal paired samples. While matched normal DNA was derived from peripheral blood, tumour DNA was extracted from FFPE tumour blocks; thus, we compared the quality metrics of sequencing data between tumour and blood specimens and evaluated the prevalence of formalin-induced DNA damages to address the impact of formalin fixation on amplicon-based NGS testing. We demonstrated that germline PGx variants can be identified with high sensitivity and precision in FFPE tumour DNA using a clinical targeted sequencing panel.

\section*{Methods}

\subsection*{Patient Samples}
Blood and FFPE tumour specimens were acquired from 213 patients who provided informed consent for The OncoPanel Pilot (TOP) study, a pilot study to optimize the OncoPanel, which is an amplicon-based targeted NGS panel for solid tumours, and assess its application for guiding disease management and therapeutic intervention. Patients in the TOP study are those with advanced cancers including colorectal cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST), and other cancers (\autoref{cancertypes}). The age of paraffin block for tumour specimens ranges from 18 to 5356 days with a median of 274 days.

\end{table}

\subsection*{OncoPanel (Solid Tumour NGS Panel)}
The OncoPanel is offered by the British Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA) for clinical genomic testing of coding exons and clinically relevant hotpots of 20 cancer-related genes and six PGx genes: \textit{DPYD}, \textit{GSTP1}, \textit{MTHFR}, \textit{TYMP}, \textit{TYMS}, and \textit{UGT1A1}. Full list of genes and gene reference models for the OncoPanel is presented in \autoref{genemodel}. Primers were designed by RainDance Technologies (Lexington, MA) using the GRCh37/hg19 reference sequence to generate 416 amplicons between 100 bp and 250 bp in size, which interrogate $\sim$ 20 kb of target bases. Target regions of the six PGx genes in the OncoPanel were assayed by 49 out of 416 amplicons. Complete lists of primers and amplicons are provided in the Supplemental Materials.

\subsection*{Sample Preparation, Library Construction, and Illumina Sequencing}
Genomic DNA was extracted from blood and FFPE tumour specimens using the Gentra Autopure LS DNA preparation platform and QIAamp DNA FFPE tissue kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) respectively. The extracted DNA was sheared according to a previously described protocol \cite{Bosdet2013} to attain approximate sizes of 3 kb followed by PCR primer merging, amplification of target regions, and adapter ligation using the Thunderstorm NGS Targeted Enrichment System (RainDance Technologies, Lexington, MA) as per manufacturer's protocol. Barcoded amplicons were sequenced with the Illumina MiSeq system for paired end sequencing with a v2 250-bp kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA).

\subsection*{Variant Calling Pipeline}
Reads that passed the Illumina Chastity filter were aligned to the GRCh37/hg19 human reference genome using the BWA mem algorithm (version 0.5.9) with default parameters, and the alignments were processed and converted to the BAM format using SAMtools (version 0.1.18). Variant calling was performed with the SAMtools \texttt{mpileup} function \texttt{(samtools mpileup -BA -d 500000 -L 500000 -q 1)} to generate pileup files for all target bases followed by the VarScan2 \texttt{mpileup2cns} (version 2.3.6) function with parameter thresholds of variant allele frequency $\geq$ 10\% and Phred-scaled base quality score $\geq$20 \texttt{(--min-var-freq 0.1 --p-value 0.01 --strand-filter 0 --output-vcf --variants --min-avg-qual 20)}. Variant calls were filtered using the VarScan2 \texttt{fpfilter} function with fraction of variant reads from each strand $\geq$ 0.1 and default thresholds for other parameters. SnpEff (version 4.2) was used for variant annotation and effect prediction whereas the SnpSift package in SnpEff was used to annotate variants with databases such as dbSNP (b138), COSMIC (version 70), 1000 Genomes Project, ClinVar, and ExAC (release 0.3) for interpretation.

\subsection*{Study Design}
This study involved retrospective analysis of tumour-normal sequencing data from 213 patients diagnosed with various advanced cancers. The matched normal specimens for this study were derived from peripheral blood, which served as controls for assessment of formalin-induced DNA damages in FFPE tumours and gold standard specimens for detecting germline variants.

\subsection*{Comparison of Amplicon Generation, Sequencing Results, and Coverage Statistics between Blood and FFPE Specimens}

Formalin fixation causes various types of DNA damage that can compromise DNA sequencing, including molecular testing with NGS approaches. Hence, we determined whether FFPE DNA is a reliable source for germline testing by comparing several NGS quality metrics between blood and FFPE tumours (\autoref{metrics}). As DNA fragmentation in FFPE specimens can result in reduced template DNA for amplicon generation, we compared the amount of amplicon generated between blood and FFPE tumours. We found a significant difference in the distributions of amplicon yield between specimen types (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, W=\num{23613}, \textit{P}\textless \num{2.2e-16}). Although the amount of DNA input for amplicon generation was also significantly different between blood and FFPE tumours (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, W=15004, \textit{P}=\num{3.5e-4}), Spearman's correlation showed that amplicon yield was weakly correlated with DNA input for amplicon generation (blood, \textit{r}=0.29, 95\% CI=0.16--0.40, \textit{P}=\num{2.1e-5}; FFPE tumour, \textit{r}=0.25, 95\% CI=0.12--0.37, \textit{P}=\num{2.5e-4}). This result implies that the difference in amplicon yield is contributed by specimen type with FFPE tumours demonstrating a lower median amplicon yield of 103.6 ng (range: 11.6--325.5 ng) than the median amplicon yield of blood, which is 299.2 ng (range: 84.0--1438.0 ng).

Furthermore, we compared read alignment between blood and FFPE libraries to examine whether the different specimen types result in comparable sequencing data. For the proportion of on-target aligned reads, which are reads that aligned to target regions used for variant calling, we found no significant difference in distributions between blood and FFPE tumours (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, W=\num{10178.5}, \textit{P}=\num{9.4e-2}). Similarly, no significant difference in the proportion of off-target aligned reads (i.e. reads that mapped to the human reference genome but not to target regions) was demonstrated between blood and FFPE tumours (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, W=\num{11494.5}, \textit{P}=\num{0.7}). However, differences in the proportions of unaligned and contaminant reads were significant between specimen types (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, unaligned: W=\num{19069}, \textit{P}=\num{5.2e-15}; contaminant: W=\num{14877}, \textit{P}=\num{9.9e-4}). While NGS libraries generated from blood and FFPE DNA differed in proportions of unaligned and contaminant reads, their libraries resulted in comparable proportions of on-target aligned reads, thereby providing equivalent amount of usable sequencing data for variant calling.

To assess the uniformity of coverage depth in blood and FFPE tumours, we measured the percentage of high quality target bases (Phred-scaled base quality score $\geq$20) with zero, $\geq$100x, and $\geq$1000x coverage depth for all libraries. Out of 431 libraries, only two libraries, one blood and one FFPE tumour, contained target bases with zero coverage depth, in which 0.006\% and 0.4\% of target bases have zero coverage depth for the blood library and FFPE library respectively. While we observed no significant difference in the percentage of target bases with $\geq$100x coverage depth (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, W=\num{243}, \textit{P}=\num{0.58}), we revealed a significant difference in the percentage of target bases with $\geq$1000x coverage depth between specimen types (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, W=\num{7268}, \textit{P}=\num{1.92e-5}). This finding shows that FFPE libraries are comprised of lower proportions of target bases with high coverage depth (i.e. 1000x) than blood libraries, in which the median percentage of $\geq$1000x target bases for FFPE libraries is 99.98\% (range: 20.61--100.00\%), whereas the median percentage of $\geq$1000x target bases for blood libraries is 100.00\% (range: 99.00--100.00\%).

Work on the summary later \ldots

Together, our comparisons of several NGS quality metrics reveal that formalin fixation can interfere with amplicon generation and sequencing depth, whereas its effect on on-target aligned reads remains negligible.

\subsection*{Evaluation of Amplicon Performance between Specimen Types}

Increased DNA fragmentation in FFPE specimens can result in lower coverage depth for longer amplicons, causing amplicon performance to vary between blood and FFPE tumours. To assess this discrepancy, we normalized coverage depth for all 416 amplicons in the OncoPanel to remove library size bias and compared the normalized coverage depth for each amplicon between blood and FFPE specimens. Using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Benjamini-Hochberg multiple hypothesis correction, we identified 369 out of 416 amplicons, which is 88.7\% of OncoPanel amplicons, that demonstrated significant differences in normalized coverage depth between specimen types (\textit{P}\textless \num{0.05}). Out of these 369 amplicons, 241 amplicons (65.3\% of amplicons that significantly differed in normalized coverage depth) presented higher median normalized coverage depths in blood than in FFPE tumours.

We next examined whether the differences in amplicon performance stem from amplicon length. For each amplicon, we calculated the percentage of libraries that met the coverage depth thresholds of $\geq$100x, $\geq$200x, $\geq$300x, $\geq$400x, and $\geq$500x, which we considered as parameters that reflected amplicon performance. Using the Spearman's correlation, we showed that amplicon performance negatively correlates with amplicon length in FFPE specimens (\textit{P}\textless \num{0.05}), whereas very weak correlations were revealed in blood specimens (Insert figure). Our observation indicates that DNA fragmentation as a result of formalin fixation, which causes discrepancy in the integrity of template DNA between blood and FFPE samples, is a probable cause of reduced amplicon performance for increased amplicon length in FFPE specimens.

Aside from amplicon length, amplicons in the OncoPanel also vary in GC content. As GC-rich and AT-rich regions are known to pose sequencing difficulties, we evaluated the effect of sequence complexity on amplicon performance using the Spearman's correlation (Insert figure).

Insert RepeatMasker results, Spearman's analysis does not make sense here but can be included in thesis etc., and work on the summary later \ldots

\subsection*{Assessment of Sequence Artifacts Induced by Formalin Fixation}
In addition to fragmentation damages in DNA, formalin fixation also induces sequence artifacts, particularly C$>$T/G$>$A transitions as a result of deamination of cytosine bases. To evaluate the prevalence of sequence artifacts in FFPE specimens, we measured the fraction of nucleotide changes for non-variant sites within the variant allele frequency ranges of 1--10\% and 11-25\%.

\textbf{In this section, I want to show that FFPE specimens have more artifactual sequence alterations compared to blood, particularly at low allele frequency. Using the replicates, I will further show that the sequence artifacts occur at low allele frequency as well. Next, TsTv ratios can be used as an indicator for "bad" FFPE samples.}

\subsection*{Correlation of Age of Paraffin Blocks and The Extent of Formalin-induced DNA Damages}

Herein, I'll show that older the paraffin block, the more extensive the DNA damages.
