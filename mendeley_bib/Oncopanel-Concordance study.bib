abstract = {BackgroundColorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States, with over 50,000 deaths estimated in 2014. Molecular profiling for somatic mutations that predict absence of response to anti-EGFR therapy has become standard practice in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer; however, the quantity and type of tissue available for testing is frequently limited. Further, the degree to which the primary tumor is a faithful representation of metastatic disease has been questioned. As next-generation sequencing technology becomes more widely available for clinical use and additional molecularly targeted agents are considered as treatment options in colorectal cancer, it is important to characterize the extent of tumor heterogeneity between primary and metastatic tumors.ResultsWe performed deep coverage, targeted next-generation sequencing of 230 key cancer-associated genes for 69 matched primary and metastatic tumors and normal tissue. Mutation profiles were 100{\%} concordant for KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF, and were highly concordant for recurrent alterations in colorectal cancer. Additionally, whole genome sequencing of four patient trios did not reveal any additional site-specific targetable alterations.ConclusionsColorectal cancer primary tumors and metastases exhibit high genomic concordance. As current clinical practices in colorectal cancer revolve around KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF mutation status, diagnostic sequencing of either primary or metastatic tissue as available is acceptable for most patients. Additionally, consistency between targeted sequencing and whole genome sequencing results suggests that targeted sequencing may be a suitable strategy for clinical diagnostic applications.},

@article{Baas2011a,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Currently, only Kirsten rat sarcoma 2 viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutational status is used as a decisional marker for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor therapy in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Concordance of KRAS status between primary tumors and metastases has always been considered to be close to perfect; however, cases of discordance have been reported. The actual rate of concordance of KRAS status remains unclear, as is the same for v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase CA subunit (PIK3CA), and loss of phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN). Therefore, it is unknown whether it is necessary to perform mutational analysis on metastases instead of on (or in addition to) primary tumors.

DESIGN: A systematic literature search was conducted to collect all studies testing concordance of KRAS in CRC, and also of BRAF, PIK3CA, and loss of PTEN.

RESULTS: Twenty-one studies have reported concordance of KRAS, with an overall concordance rate of 93{\%} (range, 76{\%}-100{\%}). Overall concordance rates of studies testing concordance of BRAF status and loss of PTEN were 98{\%} and 68{\%}, respectively. Three studies reported concordance of PIK3CA status (range, 89{\%}-94{\%}).

CONCLUSION: Though discordance of KRAS status does occur, it is uncommon. When considering the downsides of testing metastatic tissue in all patients along with the low incidence of discordance, we conclude that that testing the primary tumor (or whatever tissue available) is sufficient for clinical decision making on EGFR inhibitor therapy.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Characterization of the genomic changes that drive an individual patient's disease is critical in management of many cancers. In patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), obtaining tumor samples of sufficient size for genomic profiling on recurrence is often challenging. We undertook this study to compare genomic alterations identified in archived primary tumors from patients with NSCLC with those identified in metachronous or synchronous metastases.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Primary and matched metastatic tumor pairs from 15 patients were analyzed by using a targeted next-generation sequencing assay in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments laboratory. Genomic libraries were captured for 3,230 exons in 182 cancer-related genes plus 37 introns from 14 genes often rearranged in cancer and sequenced to high coverage.

RESULTS: Among 30 tumors, 311 genomic alterations were identified of which 63 were known recurrent (32 in primary tumor, 31 in metastasis) and 248 were nonrecurrent (likely passenger). TP53 mutations were the most frequently observed recurrent alterations (12 patients). Tumors harbored two or more (maximum four) recurrent alterations in 10 patients. Comparative analysis of recurrent alterations between primary tumor and matched metastasis revealed a concordance rate of 94{\%} compared with 63{\%} for likely passenger alterations.

CONCLUSION: This high concordance suggests that for the purposes of genomic profiling, use of archived primary tumor can identify the key recurrent somatic alterations present in matched NSCLC metastases and may provide much of the relevant genomic information required to guide treatment on recurrence.},
