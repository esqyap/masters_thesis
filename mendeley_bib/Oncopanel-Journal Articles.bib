abstract = {C-reactive protein (CRP), a blood marker of inflammation and a hallmark of the acute-phase response, has been shown to be a powerful and specific predictor of cardiovascular event risk in populations of otherwise healthy persons. Here we review what is known about CRP gene polymorphisms, discuss how these might affect the epidemiology of CRP and our understanding of CRP's contribution to cardiovascular disease, and examine their potential clinical usefulness. Evidence shows that certain subtle variations in the CRP gene sequence, mostly single nucleotide polymorphisms, predictably and strongly influence the blood level of CRP. Some of these variations are associated with clinical correlates of cardiovascular disease. If future studies can establish with certainty that CRP influences cardiovascular biology, then CRP gene profiling could have clinical utility.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Metastatic colorectal cancer is frequently treated with irinotecan, a topoisomerase-I inhibitor. The UGT1A1 gene encodes for an enzyme that metabolizes irinotecan, and its genetic variants were shown to be associated with increased drug toxicity. We evaluated clinical outcomes associated with the UGT1A1*28 variant.

METHODS: The study included 329 colorectal cancer patients from the Israeli population-based Molecular Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer study who were treated with a chemotherapy regimen that included irinotecan. Patients with metastases or disease recurrence were followed up for a median period of 2 years after occurrence of the event. Study end points were appearance of grade 3-4 hematological and gastroenterological toxicity, hospitalization due to toxic events (mostly neutropenia, fever, diarrhea, or vomiting), length of hospitalization, and overall survival. UGT1A1*28 was genotyped from peripheral blood DNA by fragment analysis and reported as number of TATA sequence repeats in the promoter of the gene.

RESULTS: The 7/7 variant of UGT1A1*28 was detected in 11.9{\%} of the 329 participants. Grade 3-4 hematological toxicity was significantly higher in 7/7 carriers compared with 6/7 and 6/6 carriers (48.0{\%},10.2{\%}, and 7.7{\%} respectively; P {\textless} .001), as was the risk of toxicity-related hospitalization (45.8{\%}, 25.3{\%}, and 14.4{\%} respectively; P = .001). Both short-term death within 2 months of treatment start (12.8{\%}, 5.2{\%}, and 2.9{\%}, respectively) and median overall survival (1.6, 2.0, and 2.4 years, respectively; P = .01) were significantly worse in the 7/7 carriers. The age/stage-adjusted hazard ratio for patients with the 7/7 genotype compared with 6/6 was 1.7 (95{\%} confidence interval, 1.1-2.3).

CONCLUSIONS: The UGT1A1*28 7/7 genotype is strongly associated with severe hematological toxicity and higher hospitalization rate and predicts lower survival of colorectal cancer in users of irinotecan.},

abstract = {AIMS: This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effects of common polymorphisms in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene on the toxicity and clinical responses of irinotecan-based chemotherapy in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC).

METHODS: The PubMed, CISCOM, CINAHL, Web of Science, Google Scholar, EBSCO, Cochrane Library, and CBM databases were searched from their inception through November 1st, 2013 without language restrictions. Meta-analysis was conducted with the use of the STATA 12.0 software. Crude odds ratios (ORs) and their 95{\%} confidence intervals (95{\%} CIs) were calculated. Seven clinical cohort studies with a total of 815 CRC patients met the inclusion criteria. Two common polymorphisms (677 C{\textgreater}T and 1298 A{\textgreater}C) in the MTHFR gene were assessed.

RESULTS: The results from our meta-analysis suggested that MTHFR genetic polymorphisms might significantly decrease the rate of grade 3/4 toxicity of irinotecan-based chemotherapy in CRC patients (OR=0.53, 95{\%} CI: 0.32-0.89, p=0.015). Furthermore, we also demonstrated that MTHFR genetic polymorphisms strongly correlated with good clinical responses (complete response+partial response) to irinotecan-based chemotherapy in CRC patients (OR=1.47, 95{\%} CI: 1.05-2.04, p=0.024).

CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide empirical evidence that MTHFR genetic polymorphisms may decrease the toxicity of irinotecan-based chemotherapy and increase the clinical benefits for CRC patients. Thus, MTHFR genetic polymorphisms may be screened to predict the clinical responses to irinotecan-based chemotherapy in CRC patients.},

abstract = {Gene polymorphisms and mutations in various types of cancer may predict clinical response to chemotherapy and related toxicity, since they may affect the metabolism of the drugs commonly used in combination chemotherapy treatments. However, conflicting data have been generated on this subject. To elucidate this issue, this review discusses the clinical applications of several genetic polymorphisms in colorectal cancer patients treated with the most common agents alone or in combination. UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)1A1 is a conjugating biotransformation enzyme that plays a role in maintaining the levels of endogenous compounds (e.g., bilirubin) and in handling exogenous compounds, including carcinogens. It has been demonstrated that the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism plays a predictive role in patients administered an irinotecan-containing regimen. Polymorphisms in XPD (Lys751Gln), a member of the nucleotide excision repair pathway, negatively affect response to therapy, with oxaliplatin/5FU reducing the survival of the patient. A similar reaction has also been observed in patients with the XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism, while patients with the GSTP1 Ile105Val polymorphism have an improved response to oxaliplatin/5FU therapy. Treatment with biological compounds such as cetuximab, an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibody, has been shown to be effective only in colon cancer patients with wild-type K-Ras. Fc polymorphisms are associated with progression-free survival in patients treated with cetuximab. Another monoclonal antibody useful in the treatment of colon cancer is bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF); however, in some cases bevacizumab may cause deep vein thrombosis (DVP). In a related vein, our recent unpublished data show that the VEGF C936T polymorphism may increase the risk of DVP in cancer patients. In conclusion, this review indicates that certain polymorphisms increase the effectiveness of certain drugs, while others greatly enhance their toxicity. The study of the genetic 'habitus' therefore appears to be crucial for the development of tailored therapy for cancer patients.},

We describe here a blinded prospective study to compare KRAS and BRAF mutation status data obtained from the analysis of tumor tissue by routine gold-standard methods and of plasma DNA using a quantitative PCR-based method specifically designed to analyze circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA). The mutation status was determined by both methods from 106 patient samples. cfDNA analysis showed 100{\%} specificity and sensitivity for the BRAF V600E mutation. For the seven tested KRAS point mutations, the method exhibited 98{\%} specificity and 92{\%} sensitivity with a concordance value of 96{\%}. Mutation load, expressed as the proportion of mutant alleles in cfDNA, was highly variable (0.5-64.1{\%}, median 10.5{\%}) among mutated samples. CfDNA was detected in 100{\%} of patients with mCRC. This study shows that liquid biopsy through cfDNA analysis could advantageously replace tumor-section analysis and expand the scope of personalized medicine for patients with cancer.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Ethnic diversity of genetic polymorphism can result in individual differences in the efficacy and toxicity of cancer chemotherapy.

METHODS: We analyzed 20 germline polymorphisms in 10 genes (TS, MTHFR, ERCC1, XPD, XRCC1, ABCC2, AGXT, GSTP1, GSTT1 and GSTM1) from prospectively enrolled 292 Korean patients treated with adjuvant oxaliplatin plus leucovorin plus 5-fluorouracil (FOLFOX) for colon cancer.

RESULTS: In contrast to previous studies in Caucasians, neutropenia (grade 3-4, 60.5 {\%}) was frequently observed, whereas only 16.4 {\%} experienced grade 2 or more sensory neuropathy. Neutropenia was more frequent in MTHFR 677TT [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.32, 95 {\%} confidence interval (CI) 1.19-4.55] and ERCC1 19007TT (adjusted OR 4.58, 95 {\%} CI 1.20-17.40) genotypes. Patients harboring XRCC1 23885GG experienced less grade 2-4 neuropathy [adjusted OR 0.52, 95 {\%} CI 0.27-0.99]. MTHFR 677TT (p = 0.002) and XRCC1 23885GG (p = 0.146) genotypes were also more prevalent in Koreans compared to Caucasians. TS 'low' genotype (adjusted HR 1.83, 95 {\%} CI 1.003-3.34) was significantly related to shorter disease-free survival. Overall survival was not significantly different according to the polymorphisms.

CONCLUSIONS: Polymorphisms in MTHFR, XRCC1 and TS are related to toxicities and disease-free survival in patients with colon cancer. The ethnic differences in frequencies of genotypes may explain the ethnic difference in toxicity profile following adjuvant FOLFOX chemotherapy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Molecular screening programs use next-generation sequencing (NGS) of cancer gene panels to analyze metastatic biopsies. We interrogated whether plasma could be used as an alternative to metastatic biopsies.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Ion AmpliSeq™ Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 (Ion Torrent), covering 2800 COSMIC mutations from 50 cancer genes was used to analyze 69 tumor (primary/metastases) and 31 plasma samples from 17 metastatic breast cancer patients. The targeted coverage for tumor DNA was ×1000 and for plasma cell-free DNA ×25 000. Whole blood normal DNA was used to exclude germline variants. The Illumina technology was used to confirm observed mutations.

RESULTS: Evaluable NGS results were obtained for 60 tumor and 31 plasma samples from 17 patients. When tumor samples were analyzed, 12 of 17 (71{\%}, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 44{\%} to 90{\%}) patients had ≥1 mutation (median 1 mutation per patient, range 0-2 mutations) in either p53, PIK3CA, PTEN, AKT1 or IDH2 gene. When plasma samples were analyzed, 12 of 17 (71{\%}, 95{\%} CI: 44-90{\%}) patients had ≥1 mutation (median 1 mutation per patient, range 0-2 mutations) in either p53, PIK3CA, PTEN, AKT1, IDH2 and SMAD4. All mutations were confirmed. When we focused on tumor and plasma samples collected at the same time-point, we observed that, in four patients, no mutation was identified in either tumor or plasma; in nine patients, the same mutations was identified in tumor and plasma; in two patients, a mutation was identified in tumor but not in plasma; in two patients, a mutation was identified in plasma but not in tumor. Thus, in 13 of 17 (76{\%}, 95{\%} CI 50{\%} to 93{\%}) patients, tumor and plasma provided concordant results whereas in 4 of 17 (24{\%}, 95{\%} CI 7{\%} to 50{\%}) patients, the results were discordant, providing complementary information.

CONCLUSION: Plasma can be prospectively tested as an alternative to metastatic biopsies in molecular screening programs.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Severe toxicity is commonly observed in cancer patients receiving irinotecan. UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) catalyzes the glucuronidation of the active metabolite SN-38. This study prospectively evaluated the association between the prevalence of severe toxicity and UGT1A1 genetic variation.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-six cancer patients with advanced disease refractory to other treatments received irinotecan 350 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks. Toxicity and pharmacokinetic data were measured during cycle 1. UGT1A1 variants (-3279G{\textgreater}T, -3156G{\textgreater}A, promoter TA indel, 211G{\textgreater}A, 686C{\textgreater}A) were genotyped.

RESULTS: The prevalence of grade 4 neutropenia was 9.5{\%}. Grade 4 neutropenia was much more common in patients with the TA indel 7/7 genotype (3 of 6 patients; 50{\%}) compared with 6/7 (3 of 24 patients; 12.5{\%}) and 6/6 (0 of 29 patients; 0{\%}) (P =.001). The TA indel genotype was significantly associated with the absolute neutrophil count nadir (7/7 {\textless} 6/7 {\textless} 6/6, P =.02). The relative risk of grade 4 neutropenia was 9.3 (95{\%} CI, 2.4 to 36.4) for the 7/7 patients versus the rest of the patients. Pretreatment total bilirubin levels (mean +/- standard deviation) were significantly higher in patients with grade 4 neutropenia (0.83 +/- 0.08 mg/dL) compared to those without grade 4 neutropenia (0.47 +/- 0.03 mg/dL; P {\textless}.001). The -3156G{\textgreater}A variant seemed to distinguish different phenotypes of total bilirubin within the TA indel genotypes. The -3156 genotype and the SN-38 area under the concentration versus time curve were significant predictors of ln(absolute neutrophil count nadir; r(2) = 0.51).

CONCLUSION: UGT1A1 genotype and total bilirubin levels are strongly associated with severe neutropenia, and could be used to identify cancer patients predisposed to the severe toxicity of irinotecan. The hypothesis that the -3156G{\textgreater}A variant is a better predictor of UGT1A1 status than the previously reported TA indel requires further testing.},

abstract = {AIM: Both Fluoropirimidine and Oxaliplatin (FluOx) are the most common anticancer drugs used to treat lung, colorectal, ovarian, breast, head/neck, and genitourinary cancers. However, the efficacy of FluOx-based therapy is often compromised because of the severe risk of toxicity. Stratification of patients for multidrug response is a promising strategy for cancer treatment and personalized therapy.

METHODS: Here, we review the late findings on the most appropriate gene variants related to the toxicity in patients receiving FluOx chemotherapy. Several criteria were used to select a genotyping panel tests, including dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPYD), thymidylate synthase (TYMS), Glutathione S-transferase (GSTP1), and ATP-binding cassette, subfamily C member 2 (ABCC2).

RESULTS: Results of allelic status from 7 validated polymorphism assays, allow the stratification of the patients who are most likely to respond to FluOx treatments. Also, we will take in consideration the usefulness and costs of the methods used to detect these polymorphisms.

CONCLUSIONS: With these pharmacogenomics markers, the oncologists will have new means based on the genetic profile of the individual, to make treatment decisions for their patients in order to maximize benefits and minimize toxicity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Predictors of the response of colorectal cancer to chemotherapy remain poorly understood. We analyzed the mRNA expression levels of enzymes related to sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil derivatives in patients with colorectal cancer.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Danenberg tumor profile method (DTP) was used in order to measure mRNA expression levels of thymidylate synthase (TYMS), dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPYD), and thymidine phosphorylase (TYMP) from 180 patients with colorectal cancer. The relations of expression levels with clinicopathological factors and outcomes were studied.

RESULTS: Higher TYMS expression was associated with greater age, DPYD expression with greater age, poorer differentiation and low invasion, and TYMP expression with poorer differentiation and lack of peritoneal metastasis. DPYD expression positively correlated with TYMP expression. In patients with stage IV disease, high DPYD or TYMP expression was associated with poor outcomes.

CONCLUSION: mRNA expression of TYMS, DPYD, and TYMP is associated with distinct characteristics and may be useful for predicting survival in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer.},

abstract = {Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may be associated with the response or toxicity to different types of treatment. Although SNP analysis is usually performed on DNA from peripheral blood, formalin fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue is often used for retrospective studies. We analyzed VEGF (-2578C{\textgreater}A, -1498C{\textgreater}T, -1154G{\textgreater}A, -634C{\textgreater}G, +936C{\textgreater}T) and eNOS (+894G{\textgreater}T, -786T{\textgreater}C, VNTR (variable number of tandem repeats) 27bp intron 4) polymorphisms by direct sequencing or Real Time PCR in 237 patients with advanced colorectal cancer. Peripheral blood was used for 153 patients, whereas only FFPE tumor tissue was available for 84 patients. All SNP frequencies were in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE), with the exception of VEGF -1154, which was only in HWE in peripheral blood specimens. We therefore analyzed this SNP in DNA extracted from FFPE tumor tissue compared to FFPE healthy tissue and peripheral blood from 20 patients. Numerous heterozygous patients in peripheral blood DNA were homozygous for the A-allele in both tumor and healthy FFPE tissues. Our findings indicate that, although FFPE tissue might be a suitable specimen for genotyping, VEGF -1154 does not give reliable results on this type of material. As other SNPs may also have this limitation, genotype concordance should first be confirmed by comparing results obtained from FFPE and fresh sample analyses.},

abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment has evolved significantly over the last ten years with the use of active chemotherapeutic agents including fluoropyrimidines, oxaliplatin and irinotecan plus targeted monoclonal antibodies bevacizumab, cetuximab and panitumumab. The addition of newer chemotherapeutic agents and targeted therapies has improved patient outcomes at the cost of increased toxicity with not all patients benefiting from these treatments. It is necessary for clinicians to more accurately predict clinical outcomes particularly in the predominantly elderly CRC patient population. This review aims to summarise existing data regarding the use of clinical and laboratory variables plus molecular markers in predicting response, survival and toxicity to chemotherapy agents and targeted monoclonal antibodies currently used in the treatment of CRC.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are promising surrogate markers for systemic disease, and their molecular characterization might be relevant to guide more individualized cancer therapies. To enable fast and efficient purification of individual CTCs, we developed a work flow from CellSearch(TM) cartridges enabling high-resolution genomic profiling on the single-cell level.

METHODS: Single CTCs were sorted from 40 CellSearch samples from patients with metastatic breast cancer using a MoFlo XDP cell sorter. Genomes of sorted single cells were amplified using an adapter-linker PCR. Amplification products were analyzed by array-based comparative genomic hybridization, a gene-specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay for cyclin D1 (CCND1) locus amplification, and genomic sequencing to screen for mutations in exons 1, 9, and 20 of the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) gene and exons 5, 7, and 8 of the tumor protein p53 (TP53) gene.

RESULTS: One common flow-sorting protocol was appropriate for 90{\%} of the analyzed CellSearch cartridges, and the detected CTC numbers correlated positively with those originally detected with the CellSearch system (R(2) = 0.9257). Whole genome amplification was successful in 72.9{\%} of the sorted single CTCs. Over 95{\%} of the cells displayed chromosomal aberrations typical for metastatic breast cancers, and amplifications at the CCND1 locus were validated by qPCR. Aberrant CTCs from 2 patients harbored mutations in exon 20 of the PIK3CA gene.

CONCLUSIONS: This work flow enabled effective CTC isolation and provided insights into genomic alterations of CTCs in metastatic breast cancer. This approach might facilitate further molecular characterization of rare CTCs to increase understanding of their biology and as a basis for their molecular screening in the clinical setting.},

abstract = {To characterize somatic alterations in colorectal carcinoma, we conducted a genome-scale analysis of 276 samples, analysing exome sequence, DNA copy number, promoter methylation and messenger RNA and microRNA expression. A subset of these samples (97) underwent low-depth-of-coverage whole-genome sequencing. In total, 16{\%} of colorectal carcinomas were found to be hypermutated: three-quarters of these had the expected high microsatellite instability, usually with hypermethylation and MLH1 silencing, and one-quarter had somatic mismatch-repair gene and polymerase $\epsilon$ (POLE) mutations. Excluding the hypermutated cancers, colon and rectum cancers were found to have considerably similar patterns of genomic alteration. Twenty-four genes were significantly mutated, and in addition to the expected APC, TP53, SMAD4, PIK3CA and KRAS mutations, we found frequent mutations in ARID1A, SOX9 and FAM123B. Recurrent copy-number alterations include potentially drug-targetable amplifications of ERBB2 and newly discovered amplification of IGF2. Recurrent chromosomal translocations include the fusion of NAV2 and WNT pathway member TCF7L1. Integrative analyses suggest new markers for aggressive colorectal carcinoma and an important role for MYC-directed transcriptional activation and repression.},

@article{Cortejoso2013a,
abstract = {PURPOSE: Oxaliplatin or irinotecan is usually administered jointly with fluoropyrimidines in colorectal cancer patients treated with chemotherapy. Both drugs have different toxicity patterns. Biomarkers for predicting high-risk severe adverse reactions can help select the best treatment.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 106 colorectal cancer patients receiving an oxaliplatin-based treatment and 56 receiving an irinotecan-based treatment was performed. One copy number variant (GSTT1) and nine polymorphisms in irinotecan and oxaliplatin metabolism, transport or DNA repair genes (ABCB1, UGT1A1, XRCC1, ERCC1, ERCC2, GSTP1) were genotyped by SNaPshot, polymerase chain reactions' length fragments, or copy number assays.

RESULTS: In irinotecan-treated patients, T allele of ABCB1C1236T SNP was associated with a lower risk of asthenia(OR = 0.047; 95 {\%} CI = 0.004–0.493; P = 0.011) and Tallele of ABCB1 C3435T SNP was associated with a lower risk of diarrhea (OR = 0.177; 95 {\%} CI = 0.034–0.919;P = 0.039), and individuals with two copies of GSTT1 gene had a lower risk for asthenia (OR = 0.093; 95 {\%}CI = 0.011–0.794; P = 0.030). In oxaliplatin-treated patients, carriers of one or two T variants of Asn118Asn ERCC1 SNP had a lower risk for neutropenia(OR = 0.205; 95 {\%} CI = 0.061–0.690; P = 0.01) [corrected].

CONCLUSIONS: These biomarkers could help oncologists select the best treatment by reducing toxicity associated with irinotecan or oxaliplatin in colorectal cancer patients, thus increasing their quality of life.},
