abstract = {Different combinations of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), oxaliplatin, irinotecan and other newly developed agents have been used to treat colorectal cancer. Despite the advent of new treatment regimens, the 5-year survival rate for metastatic colorectal cancer remains low ({\~{}}10{\%}). Knowing the drug sensitivity of a given tumor for a particular agent could significantly impact decision making and treatment planning. Biomarkers are proven to be successful in characterizing patients into different response groups. Using survival prediction analysis, we have identified three independent gene signatures, which are associated with sensitivity of colorectal cancer cells to 5-FU, oxaliplatin or irinotecan. On the basis of the three gene signatures, three score systems were developed to stratify patients from sensitive to resistance. These score systems exhibited robustness in stratify patients in two independent clinical studies. Patients with high scores in all three drugs exhibited the lowest survival.The Pharmacogenomics Journal advance online publication, 2 September 2014; doi:10.1038/tpj.2014.45.},

abstract = {Interindividual differences in drug disposition are important causes for adverse drug reactions and lack of drug response. The majority of phase I and phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) are polymorphic and constitute essential factors for the outcome of drug therapy. Recently, both genome-wide association (GWA) studies with a focus on drug response, as well as more targeted studies of genes encoding DMEs have revealed in-depth information and provided additional information for variation in drug metabolism and drug response, resulting in increased knowledge that aids drug development and clinical practice. In addition, an increasing number of meta-analyses have been published based on several original and often conflicting pharmacogenetic studies. Here, we review data regarding the pharmacogenomics of DMEs, with particular emphasis on novelties. We conclude that recent studies have emphasized the importance of CYP2C19 polymorphism for the effects of clopidogrel, whereas the CYP2C9 polymorphism appears to have a role in anticoagulant treatment, although inferior to VKORC1. Furthermore, the analgesic and side effects of codeine in relation to CYP2D6 polymorphism are supported and the influence of CYP2D6 genotype on breast cancer recurrence during tamoxifen treatment appears relevant as based on three large studies. The influence of CYP2D6 polymorphism on the effect of antidepressants in a clinical setting is yet without any firm evidence, and the relation between CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizers and suicide behavior warrants further studies. There is evidence for the influence of CYP3A5 polymorphism on tacrolimus dose, although the influence on response is less studied. Recent large GWA studies support a link between CYP1A2 polymorphism and blood pressure as well as coffee consumption, and between CYP2A6 polymorphism and cigarette consumption, which in turn appears to influence the lung cancer incidence. Regarding phase II enzyme polymorphism, the anticancer treatment with mercaptopurines and irinotecan is still considered important in relation to the polymorphism of TPMT and UGT1A1, respectively. There is a need for further clarification of the clinical importance and use of all these findings, but the recent research in the field that encompasses larger studies and a whole genome perspective, improves the possibilities be able to make firm and cost-effective recommendations for drug treatment in the future.},
