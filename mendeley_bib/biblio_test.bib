abstract = {SUMMARY: The variant call format (VCF) is a generic format for storing DNA polymorphism data such as SNPs, insertions, deletions and structural variants, together with rich annotations. VCF is usually stored in a compressed manner and can be indexed for fast data retrieval of variants from a range of positions on the reference genome. The format was developed for the 1000 Genomes Project, and has also been adopted by other projects such as UK10K, dbSNP and the NHLBI Exome Project. VCFtools is a software suite that implements various utilities for processing VCF files, including validation, merging, comparing and also provides a general Perl API.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY: http://vcftools.sourceforge.net},

Serious dose-limiting side effects like ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity occur with the use of this agent. This review summarizes recent important clinical and experimental investigations of cisplatin ototoxicity. It also discusses the utility of protective agents employed in patients and in experimental animals. The future strategies for limiting cisplatin ototoxicity will need to avoid interference with the therapeutic effect of cisplatin in order to enhance the quality of life of patients receiving this important anti-tumor agent.},

Toxicity was documented according to World Health Organization grades. DPYD, TYMS, and MTHFR genotypes were determined, and DPYD was resequenced in patients with severe toxicity.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Grade 3 to 4 toxicity occurred in 16.1{\%} of patients. The sensitivity of DPYD*2A genotyping for overall toxicity was 5.5{\%} (95{\%}CI, 0.02 to 0.11), with a positive predictive value of 0.46 (95{\%} CI, 0.19 to 0.75; P = .01). Inclusion of additional DPYD variants improved prediction only marginally. Analysis according to toxicity type revealed significant association of DPYD with mucositis and leukopenia, whereas TYMS was associated with diarrhea. Genotype, female sex, mode of FU administration, and modulation by folinic acid were identified as independent risk factors by multivariable analysis. A previously unrecognized significant interaction was found between sex and DPYD, which resulted in an odds ratio for toxicity of 41.8 for male patients (95{\%} CI, 9.2 to 190; P {\textless} .0001) but only 1.33 (95{\%} CI, 0.34 to 5.2) in female patients. Homozygosity for the TYMS enhancer region double repeat allele increased risk for toxicity 1.6-fold (95{\%} CI, 1.08 to 2.22; P = .02).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: DPYD, TYMS, and MTHFR play a limited role for FU related toxicity but a pronounced DPYD gene/sex-interaction increases prediction rate for male patients. Toxicity risk assessment should include sex, mode of administration, and folinic acid as additional predictive factors.},

abstract = {Cancer is one of the therapeutic areas where pharmacogenomics, PGx, is already being applied in the clinical setting [Articles:23394393, 23837482]. Diagnostic tests are used to select the targeted cancer therapy most appropriate for a patients tumor type [Article:23837482]. Diagnostic tests measure biomarkers. Biomarkers can be alterations in genes, gene products such as mRNAs or proteins, or chromosomes, they may be mutated or increased in expression or activity in the cancer cells relative to the rest of the body. Cancer PGx can be divided into two areas. 1.Variants in the tumor/cancer cells that often may be part of the neoplastic process ie. somatic mutations. The gene exhibiting the variation is frequently the drug target. These variants may be used to select treatment or predictive of response to treatment. 2.Germline/variants present throughout the body that are usually (but not always) relating to drug PK. PharmGKB captures clinical and preclinical/research PGx from the literature and from drug labels and provides annotations linking specific variants and drug response, dosing guidelines where available, detailed gene summaries and drug pathways.},

abstract = {Glucuronidation catalyzed by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) is one of the most important mechanisms for host defense against xenobiotics and endobiotics. Although genetic polymorphisms of several UGT1A isoforms have been reported separately, the haplotypes in all functional exons have not been identified, and little information is available regarding single nucleotide polymorphisms in Koreans. We analyzed genetic polymorphisms in all functional exons of the UGT1A locus by direct sequencing of genomic DNA from 50 healthy Korean subjects, and their haplotypes were inferred from genotype data using an expectation-maximization algorithm. We identified 67 polymorphisms, including three novel single nucleotide polymorphisms, 233C{\textgreater}T in UGT1A1 (T78M), 292C{\textgreater}T in 1A4 (Q98Stop), and 701T{\textgreater}C in 1A7 (I234T). Two amino acid substitutions, 1A4 Q98Stop and 1A7 I234T, were each associated with a decrease of enzymatic activity, whereas UGT1A1 T78M had no significant influence on catalytic function. The frequencies of the known variants in Koreans differed significantly from those reported in other ethnic groups. Haplotype analysis was performed within the polymorphisms in each UGT1A isoform as well as across the isoforms. Based on strong linkage disequilibrium within UGT1A7, between 1A5 and 1A4, and within 1A3, the complex was divided into three blocks, Block 7, Block 5/4, and Block 3. The haplotypes for each block were subsequently determined, revealing a profile that differed from those of other ethnic groups. These results suggest that genetic polymorphisms of the UGT1A locus differ between Koreans and other ethnic populations. Such differences should be considered in pharmacogenetic studies.},

abstract = {Detection of somatic point substitutions is a key step in characterizing the cancer genome. However, existing methods typically miss low-allelic-fraction mutations that occur in only a subset of the sequenced cells owing to either tumor heterogeneity or contamination by normal cells. Here we present MuTect, a method that applies a Bayesian classifier to detect somatic mutations with very low allele fractions, requiring only a few supporting reads, followed by carefully tuned filters that ensure high specificity. We also describe benchmarking approaches that use real, rather than simulated, sequencing data to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity as a function of sequencing depth, base quality and allelic fraction. Compared with other methods, MuTect has higher sensitivity with similar specificity, especially for mutations with allelic fractions as low as 0.1 and below, making MuTect particularly useful for studying cancer subclones and their evolution in standard exome and genome sequencing data.$\backslash$nView full text},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s).Background: Detection of DNA mutations at very low allele fractions with high accuracy will significantly improve the effectiveness of precision medicine for cancer patients. To achieve this goal through next generation sequencing, researchers need a detection method that 1) captures rare mutation-containing DNA fragments efficiently in the mix of abundant wild-type DNA; 2) sequences the DNA library extensively to deep coverage; and 3) distinguishes low level true variants from amplification and sequencing errors with high accuracy. Targeted enrichment using PCR primers provides researchers with a convenient way to achieve deep sequencing for a small, yet most relevant region using benchtop sequencers. Molecular barcoding (or indexing) provides a unique solution for reducing sequencing artifacts analytically. Although different molecular barcoding schemes have been reported in recent literature, most variant calling has been done on limited targets, using simple custom scripts. The analytical performance of barcode-aware variant calling can be significantly improved by incorporating advanced statistical models. Results: We present here a highly efficient, simple and scalable enrichment protocol that integrates molecular barcodes in multiplex PCR amplification. In addition, we developed smCounter, an open source, generic, barcode-aware variant caller based on a Bayesian probabilistic model. smCounter was optimized and benchmarked on two independent read sets with SNVs and indels at 5 and 1{\%} allele fractions. Variants were called with very good sensitivity and specificity within coding regions. Conclusions: We demonstrated that we can accurately detect somatic mutations with allele fractions as low as 1{\%} in coding regions using our enrichment protocol and variant caller.},

abstract = {Background: Vemurafenib is an oral, small-molecule kinase inhibitor that selectively targets activated BRAF V600E and has been approved for the treatment of advanced BRAF mutation-positive melanoma. Objective: This article reviews the clinical pharmacology, efficacy, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of vemurafenib and in addition outlines proposed mechanisms of vemurafenib resistance. Methods: A literature search of MEDLINE and ScienceVerse Scopus was performed using the key words malignant melanoma, BRAF, vemurafenib, and PLX4032. Scientific abstracts, US Food and Drug Administration Web site data (www.accessdata.fda.gov), the manufacturer-submitted approval data from ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the references from applicable publications were also consulted. Results: Clinical studies have reported that vemurafenib is efficacious and acceptably well-tolerated. In a Phase I study (BRIM-1), a 960-mg BID dose achieved an objective response rate of 81{\%} among 32 patients with melanoma who carried a BRAF V600E mutation. Of the 26 responders, 2 achieved a complete response and 24 a partial response. In BRIM-2, 132 BRAF V600E-positive patients achieved an overall response rate of 53{\%} (95{\%} CI, 44{\%}-62{\%}); 6{\%} achieved a complete response and 47{\%}, a partial response. Response was noted at 6 weeks and lasted a median of 6.7 months (95{\%} CI, 5.6-8.6). Median survival was 15.9 months (95{\%} CI, 11.6-18.3); 77{\%} of patients survived to 6 months (95{\%} CI, 70-85) and 58{\%} to 12 months (95{\%} CI, 11.6-18.3), and an estimated 43{\%} were expected to survive to 18 months (95{\%} CI, 33-53). The Phase III study (BRIM-3) compared vemurafenib to dacarbazine. The hazard ratio (HR) for death with vemurafenib was 0.37 (95{\%} CI, 0.26-0.55; P {\textless} 0.001). At 6 months, overall survival was 84{\%} (95{\%} CI, 78-89) versus 64{\%} (95{\%} CI, 56-73) in the vemurafenib and dacarbazine treatment arms, respectively. The HR for tumor progression in the vemurafenib cohort was 0.26 (95{\%} CI, 0.20-0.33; P {\textless} 0.001), and the estimated median progression-free survival was 5.3 months with vemurafenib versus 1.6 months with dacarbazine. Finally, the difference in response rates was significant (48{\%} vs 5{\%}, respectively; P {\textless} 0.001). The most common adverse events reported have been arthralgia, rash, photosensitivity, fatigue, pruritus, alopecia, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, diarrhea, and mild to moderate nausea. Conclusions: Vemurafenib is effective for advanced melanomas expressing the BRAF V600E mutations. Resistance to BRAF inhibition can be problematic, but new evidence suggests that combination therapy may attenuate the issue. Targeting the cellular activity of melanoma cells is reported to be efficacious and is expected to delay progression and prolong survival. ?? 2012 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.},

Here, we evaluate the feasibility of obtaining detailed and comprehensive cost information on patients who experience febrile neutropenia during cancer chemotherapy treatment.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Community oncology cancer patients who experienced chemotherapy-associated febrile neutropenia recorded information about use of medical care, tests, devices, medications, and lost productivity. Direct cost estimates were derived from Medicare Physician Fee Schedules and cost-to-charge ratios. Indirect cost estimates were based on modified Labor Force, Employment, and Earnings data for employed patients and wages earned by paid caregivers. Multivariate regression models evaluated predictors of higher direct, indirect, and total costs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Outpatients' mean direct and indirect costs were 5,704 dollars and 1,201 dollars (lymphoma), 1,094 dollars and 1,530 dollars (breast cancer), and 1,329 dollars and 1,325 dollars (lung cancer and myeloma), respectively. The mean direct and indirect costs were three- to tenfold and 1.5- to threefold greater for inpatients, respectively. Factors associated with higher direct costs of care included diagnosis of lymphoma and inpatient care; higher indirect costs, male versus female gender; higher total costs, lymphoma diagnosis and inpatient care.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Estimation of the total costs of cancer-related neutropenia is feasible. Indirect costs appear to account for as much as half of the total supportive care costs when febrile neutropenia is managed in the outpatient setting and about one fifth of the total supportive care costs in the inpatient setting.},

abstract = {Background: The best-known cause of intolerance to fluoropyrimidines is dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency, which can result from deleterious polymorphisms in the gene encoding DPD (DPYD), including DPYD*2A and c.2846A{\textgreater}T. Three other variants-DPYD c.1679T{\textgreater}G, c.1236G{\textgreater}A/HapB3, and c.1601G{\textgreater}A-have been associated with DPD deficiency, but no definitive evidence for the clinical validity of these variants is available. The primary objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the clinical validity of c.1679T{\textgreater}G, c.1236G{\textgreater}A/HapB3, and c.1601G{\textgreater}A as predictors of severe fluoropyrimidine-associated toxicity. Methods: We did a systematic review of the literature published before Dec 17, 2014, to identify cohort studies investigating associations between DPYD c.1679T{\textgreater}G, c.1236G{\textgreater}A/HapB3, and c.1601G{\textgreater}A and severe (grade ≥3) fluoropyrimidine-associated toxicity in patients treated with fluoropyrimidines (fluorouracil, capecitabine, or tegafur-uracil as single agents, in combination with other anticancer drugs, or with radiotherapy). Individual patient data were retrieved and analysed in a multivariable analysis to obtain an adjusted relative risk (RR). Effect estimates were pooled by use of a random-effects meta-analysis. The threshold for significance was set at a p value of less than 0{\textperiodcentered}0167 (Bonferroni correction). Findings: 7365 patients from eight studies were included in the meta-analysis. DPYD c.1679T{\textgreater}G was significantly associated with fluoropyrimidine-associated toxicity (adjusted RR 4{\textperiodcentered}40, 95{\%} CI 2{\textperiodcentered}08-9{\textperiodcentered}30, p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001), as was c.1236G{\textgreater}A/HapB3 (1{\textperiodcentered}59, 1{\textperiodcentered}29-1{\textperiodcentered}97, p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001). The association between c.1601G{\textgreater}A and fluoropyrimidine-associated toxicity was not significant (adjusted RR 1{\textperiodcentered}52, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}86-2{\textperiodcentered}70, p=0{\textperiodcentered}15). Analysis of individual types of toxicity showed consistent associations of c.1679T{\textgreater}G and c.1236G{\textgreater}A/HapB3 with gastrointestinal toxicity (adjusted RR 5{\textperiodcentered}72, 95{\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}40-23{\textperiodcentered}33, p=0{\textperiodcentered}015; and 2{\textperiodcentered}04, 1{\textperiodcentered}49-2{\textperiodcentered}78, p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001, respectively) and haematological toxicity (adjusted RR 9{\textperiodcentered}76, 95{\%} CI 3{\textperiodcentered}03-31{\textperiodcentered}48, p=0{\textperiodcentered}00014; and 2{\textperiodcentered}07, 1{\textperiodcentered}17-3{\textperiodcentered}68, p=0{\textperiodcentered}013, respectively), but not with hand-foot syndrome. DPYD*2A and c.2846A{\textgreater}T were also significantly associated with severe fluoropyrimidine-associated toxicity (adjusted RR 2{\textperiodcentered}85, 95{\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}75-4{\textperiodcentered}62, p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001; and 3{\textperiodcentered}02, 2{\textperiodcentered}22-4{\textperiodcentered}10, p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001, respectively). Interpretation: DPYD variants c.1679T{\textgreater}G and c.1236G{\textgreater}A/HapB3 are clinically relevant predictors of fluoropyrimidine-associated toxicity. Upfront screening for these variants, in addition to the established variants DPYD*2A and c.2846A{\textgreater}T, is recommended to improve the safety of patients with cancer treated with fluoropyrimidines.

abstract = {Although the last few years have seen great progress in DNA sequence retrieval from fossil specimens, some of the characteristics of ancient DNA remain poorly understood. This is particularly true for blocking lesions, i.e. chemical alterations that cannot be bypassed by DNA polymerases and thus prevent amplification and subsequent sequencing of affected molecules. Some studies have concluded that the vast majority of ancient DNA molecules carry blocking lesions, suggesting that the removal, repair or bypass of blocking lesions might dramatically increase both the time depth and geographical range of specimens available for ancient DNA analysis. However, previous studies used very indirect detection methods that did not provide conclusive estimates on the frequency of blocking lesions in endogenous ancient DNA. We developed a new method, polymerase extension profiling (PEP), that directly reveals occurrences of polymerase stalling on DNA templates. By sequencing thousands of single primer extension products using PEP methodology, we have for the first time directly identified blocking lesions in ancient DNA on a single molecule level. Although we found clear evidence for blocking lesions in three out of four ancient samples, no more than 40{\%} of the molecules were affected in any of the samples, indicating that such modifications are far less frequent in ancient DNA than previously thought.},

abstract = {Background: Breast cancer is treated with many different modalities, including chemotherapy that can be given as a single agent or in combination. Patients often experience adverse events from chemotherapy during the cycles of treatment which can lead to economic burden. Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate costs related to chemotherapy-related adverse events in patients with metastatic breast cancer (mBC) in an integrated health care delivery system. Methods: Patients with mBC newly initiated on chemotherapy were identified and the first infusion was defined as the index date. Patients were ≥18 years old at time of index date, had at least 6 months of health plan membership and drug eligibility prior to their index date. The chemotherapy adverse events were identified after the index date and during first line of chemotherapy. Episodes of care (EOC) were created using healthcare visits. Chart review was conducted to establish whether the adverse events were related to chemotherapy. Costs were calculated for each visit, including medications related to the adverse events, and aggregated to calculate the total EOC cost. Results: A total of 1,682 patients with mBC were identified after applying study criteria; 54{\%} of these patients had one or more adverse events related to chemotherapy. After applying the EOC method, there were a total of 5,475 episodes (4,185 single episodes [76.4{\%}] and 1,290 multiple episodes [23.6{\%}]) related to chemotherapy-related adverse events. Within single episodes, hematological (1,387 EOC, 33.1{\%}), musculoskeletal/pain related (1,070 EOC, 25.6{\%}), and gastrointestinal (775 EOC, 18.5{\%}) were the most frequent adverse events. Patients with adverse events related to single EOC with anemia and neutropenia had the highest total outpatient costs with 901 EOC ({\$}81,991) and 187 EOC ({\$}17,017); these patients also had highest total inpatient costs with 46 EOC ({\$}542,798) and 16 EOC ({\$}136,768). However, within multiple episodes, hematological (420 EOC, 32.6{\%}), followed by infections/pyrexia (335 EOC, 25.9{\%}) and gastrointestinal (278 EOC, 22.6{\%}) were the most frequent adverse events. Conclusion: The economic burden related to chemotherapy adverse events in patients with mBC is substantial.},

abstract = {Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among the women around the world. Several genes are known to be responsible for conferring the susceptibility to breast cancer. Among them, TP53 is one of the major genetic risk factor which is known to be mutated in many of the breast tumor types. TP53 mutations in breast cancer are known to be related to a poor prognosis and chemo resistance. This renders them as a promising molecular target for the treatment of breast cancer. In this study, we present a computational based screening and molecular dynamic simulation of breast cancer associated deleterious non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms in TP53. We have predicted three deleterious coding non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms rs11540654 (R110P), rs17849781 (P278A) and rs28934874 (P151T) in TP53 with a phenotype in breast tumors using computational tools SIFT, Polyphen-2 and MutDB. We have performed molecular dynamics simulations to study the structural and dynamic effects of these TP53 mutations in comparison to the wild-type protein. Results from our simulations revealed a detailed consequence of the mutations on the p53 DNA-binding core domain that may provide insight for therapeutic approaches in breast cancer.},

This gene has been shown to be amplified in human breast cancer cell lines. In the current study, alterations of the gene in 189 primary human breast cancers were investigated. HER-2/neu was found to be amplified from 2- to greater than 20-fold in 30{\%} of the tumors. Correlation of gene amplification with several disease parameters was evaluated. Amplification of the HER-2/neu gene was a significant predictor of both overall survival and time to relapse in patients with breast cancer. It retained its significance even when adjustments were made for other known prognostic factors. Moreover, HER-2/neu amplification had greater prognostic value than most currently used prognostic factors, including hormonal-receptor status, in lymph node-positive disease. These data indicate that this gene may play a role in the biologic behavior and/or pathogenesis of human breast cancer.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Variants in numerous genes are thought to affect the success or failure of cancer chemotherapy. Interindividual variability can result from genes involved in drug metabolism and transport, drug targets (receptors, enzymes, etc), and proteins relevant to cell survival (e.g., cell cycle, DNA repair, and apoptosis). The purpose of the current study is to establish a flexible, cost effective,high-throughput genotyping platform for candidate genes involved in chemo resistance and -sensitivity, and treatment outcomes. METHODS: We have adopted SNPlex for genotyping 432 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)in 160 candidate genes implicated in response to anticancer chemotherapy. RESULTS: The genotyping panels were applied to 39 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia undergoing flavopiridol chemotherapy, and 90 patients with colorectal cancer. 408 SNPs (94{\%})produced successful genotyping results. Additional genotyping methods were established for polymorphisms undetectable by SNPlex, including multiplexed SNaPshot for CYP2D6 SNPs, andPCR amplification with fluorescently labeled primers for the UGT1A1 promoter (TA)nTAA repeat polymorphism. CONCLUSION: This genotyping panel is useful for supporting clinical anticancer drug trials to identify polymorphisms that contribute to interindividual variability in drug response. Availability of population genetic data across multiple studies has the potential to yield genetic biomarkers for optimizing anticancer therapy.},

abstract = {Over 15,000 human tumor p53 mutations have been recorded in the scientific literature, including over 700 mutations in esophageal tumors. There are no data on p53 mutations in esophageal cancer patients from Iran yet; however, this country experiences one of the highest cancer mortality rates in the world for esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs). The causes of this high cancer burden in Iran remain obscure and do not appear to be related to tobacco and alcohol consumption, the two major risk factors identified in Europe and North America. Because molecular analysis of tumors can provide clues to endogenous or environmental factors contributing to high cancer risk, we examined 74 Iranian ESCCs for the presence of mutations in exons 5-8 of the p53 gene by PCR and direct sequencing. Forty-eight of the 74 tumors (65{\%}) had one or more p53 gene point mutations, including 5 patients with two or more mutations and one with a tandem mutation in codon 242. Surprisingly, over one-third of the 54 mutations we identified were transitions at CpG sites (20 of a total of 54 mutations, or 37{\%}), a class of mutation that is significantly less common (16{\%} of mutations) in the compilation of ESCC mutations from other countries (chi2 statistic, P {\textless} 0.0002), whereas transversions, which the literature shows to be common in ESCCs from non-Iranian patients, were infrequent in the tumors we examined here. Elevated levels of cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase were observed in 74 and 91{\%}, respectively, of tumors from Tehran as determined by immunohistochemistry, and high COX-2 expression correlated significantly with the presence of a p53 mutation in the tumor. Mediators of the inflammatory response in esophageal mucosa, perhaps in conjunction with specific dietary or cultural practices in Iran, may contribute importantly to the p53 mutation load in Iranian ESCC patients.},

abstract = {Many genomes have been sequenced to high-quality draft status using Sanger capillary electrophoresis and/or newer short-read sequence data and whole genome assembly techniques. However, even the best draft genomes contain gaps and other imperfections due to limitations in the input data and the techniques used to build draft assemblies. Sequencing biases, repetitive genomic features, genomic polymorphism, and other complicating factors all come together to make some regions difficult or impossible to assemble. Traditionally, draft genomes were upgraded to "phase 3 finished" status using time-consuming and expensive Sanger-based manual finishing processes. For more facile assembly and automated finishing of draft genomes, we present here an automated approach to finishing using long-reads from the Pacific Biosciences RS (PacBio) platform. Our algorithm and associated software tool, PBJelly, (publicly available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/pb-jelly/) automates the finishing process using long sequence reads in a reference-guided assembly process. PBJelly also provides "lift-over" co-ordinate tables to easily port existing annotations to the upgraded assembly. Using PBJelly and long PacBio reads, we upgraded the draft genome sequences of a simulated Drosophila melanogaster, the version 2 draft Drosophila pseudoobscura, an assembly of the Assemblathon 2.0 budgerigar dataset, and a preliminary assembly of the Sooty mangabey. With 24× mapped coverage of PacBio long-reads, we addressed 99{\%} of gaps and were able to close 69{\%} and improve 12{\%} of all gaps in D. pseudoobscura. With 4× mapped coverage of PacBio long-reads we saw reads address 63{\%} of gaps in our budgerigar assembly, of which 32{\%} were closed and 63{\%} improved. With 6.8× mapped coverage of mangabey PacBio long-reads we addressed 97{\%} of gaps and closed 66{\%} of addressed gaps and improved 19{\%}. The accuracy of gap closure was validated by comparison to Sanger sequencing on gaps from the original D. pseudoobscura draft assembly and shown to be dependent on initial reference quality.},

abstract = {Next-generation sequencing has aided characterization of genomic variation. While whole-genome sequencing may capture all possible mutations, whole-exome sequencing remains cost-effective and captures most phenotype-altering mutations. Initial strategies for exome enrichment utilized a hybridization-based capture approach. Recently, amplicon-based methods were designed to simplify preparation and utilize smaller DNA inputs. We evaluated two hybridization capture-based and two amplicon-based whole-exome sequencing approaches, utilizing both Illumina and Ion Torrent sequencers, comparing on-target alignment, uniformity, and variant calling. While the amplicon methods had higher on-target rates, the hybridization capture-based approaches demonstrated better uniformity. All methods identified many of the same single-nucleotide variants, but each amplicon-based method missed variants detected by the other three methods and reported additional variants discordant with all three other technologies. Many of these potential false positives or negatives appear to result from limited coverage, low variant frequency, vicinity to read starts/ends, or the need for platform-specific variant calling algorithms. All methods demonstrated effective copy-number variant calling when evaluated against a single-nucleotide polymorphism array. This study illustrates some differences between whole-exome sequencing approaches, highlights the need for selecting appropriate variant calling based on capture method, and will aid laboratories in selecting their preferred approach.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Many programs for aligning short sequencing reads to a reference genome have been developed in the last 2 years. Most of them are very efficient for short reads but inefficient or not applicable for reads {\textgreater}200 bp because the algorithms are heavily and specifically tuned for short queries with low sequencing error rate. However, some sequencing platforms already produce longer reads and others are expected to become available soon. For longer reads, hashing-based software such as BLAT and SSAHA2 remain the only choices. Nonetheless, these methods are substantially slower than short-read aligners in terms of aligned bases per unit time. RESULTS: We designed and implemented a new algorithm, Burrows-Wheeler Aligner's Smith-Waterman Alignment (BWA-SW), to align long sequences up to 1 Mb against a large sequence database (e.g. the human genome) with a few gigabytes of memory. The algorithm is as accurate as SSAHA2, more accurate than BLAT, and is several to tens of times faster than both. AVAILABILITY: http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net},

This period was also a time of intensive development of molecular biology techniques and enormous knowledge growth in the biology of cancer. For clinical use in the treatment of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC), in addition to fluoropyrimidines, another two new cytostatic drugs were allowed: irinotecan and oxaliplatin. Intensive research into new treatment regimens and a new generation of drugs used in targeted therapy has also been conducted. The last 20 years was a time of numerous in vitro and in vivo studies on the molecular basis of drug resistance. One of the most important factors limiting the effectiveness of chemotherapy is the primary and secondary resistance of cancer cells. Understanding the genetic factors and mechanisms that contribute to the lack of or low sensitivity of tumour tissue to cytostatics is a key element in the currently developing trend of personalized medicine. Scientists hope to increase the percentage of positive treatment response in CRC patients due to practical applications of pharmacogenetics/pharmacogenomics. Over the past 20 years the clinical usability of different predictive markers has been tested among which only a few have been confirmed to have high application potential. This review is a synthetic presentation of drug resistance in the context of CRC patient chemotherapy. The multifactorial nature and volume of the issues involved do not allow the author to present a comprehensive study on this subject in one review.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The objective is to investigate whether polymorphisms with putative influence on fluorouracil/oxaliplatin activity are associated with clinical outcomes of patients with advanced colorectal cancer treated with first-line oxaliplatin, folinic acid, and fluorouracil palliative chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients were prospectively enrolled onto medical oncology units in Central Italy. Patients were required to have cytologically/histologically confirmed metastatic disease with at least one measurable lesion. Peripheral blood samples were used for genotyping 12 polymorphisms in thymidylate synthase, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, xeroderma pigmentosum group D (XPD), excision repair cross complementing group 1 (ERCC1), x-ray cross complementing group 1, x-ray cross complementing protein 3, glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) genes. The primary end point of the study was to investigate the association between genotypes and progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: In 166 patients, ERCC1-118 T/T, XPD-751 A/C, and XPD-751 C/C genotypes were independently associated with adverse PFS. The presence of two risk genotypes (ERCC1-118 T/T combined with either XPD-751 A/C or XPD-751 C/C) occurred in 50 patients (31{\%}). This profiling showed an independent role for unfavorable PFS with a hazard ratio of 2.84{\%} and 95{\%} CI of 1.47 to 5.45 (P = .002). Neurotoxicity was significantly associated with GSTP1-105 A/G. Carriers of the GSTP1-105 G/G genotype were more prone to suffer from grade 3 neurotoxicity than carriers of GSTP1-105 A/G and GSTP1-105 A/A genotypes. CONCLUSION: A pharmacogenetic approach may be an innovative strategy for optimizing palliative chemotherapy in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. These findings deserve confirmation in additional prospective studies.},

The auto-regulatory feedback mechanism of the P53 and MDM2 expression is critical in keeping proper tumor suppressor function of this pathway. This study examined the effect of P53 Arg72Pro variants on transactivation of polymorphic MDM2 promoter (T309G) and their associations with risk of developing gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA) in a Chinese population. Luciferase assays consistently showed a significantly higher activity of the MDM2 309G promoter compared with the MDM2 309T promoter. In cells co-transfected with variant P53 cDNAs, P53-72Pro displayed a significantly higher ability to activate the MDM2 promoter than P53-72Arg. Genotype analyses in 500 GCA patients and 1000 controls showed that significantly increased risk for developing GCA was associated with the MDM2 309G and the P53 72Pro allele compared with the MDM2 309T and the P53 72Arg allele in an allele dose-dependent manner. A joint effect between the MDM2 and P53 polymorphisms in intensifying GCA risk was detected, with the odds ratio (OR) for the presence of both MDM2 390GG and P53 72Pro/Pro genotypes being 5.05 [95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 2.50-10.20]. These results suggest that the P53 72Pro and MDM2 309G polymorphisms contribute to the risk of developing GCA.},

abstract = {Background: Clinical specimens undergoing diagnostic molecular pathology testing are fixed in formalin due to the necessity for detailed morphological assessment. However, formalin fixation can cause major issues with molecular testing, as it causes DNA damage such as fragmentation and non-reproducible sequencing artefacts after PCR amplification. In the context of massively parallel sequencing (MPS), distinguishing true low frequency variants from sequencing artefacts remains challenging. The prevalence of formalin-induced DNA damage and its impact on molecular testing and clinical genomics remains poorly understood. Methods: The Cancer 2015 study is a population-based cancer cohort used to assess the feasibility of mutational screening using MPS in cancer patients from Victoria, Australia. While blocks were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded in different anatomical pathology laboratories, they were centrally extracted for DNA utilising the same protocol, and run through the same MPS platform (Illumina TruSeq Amplicon Cancer Panel). The sequencing artefacts in the 1-10{\%} and the 10-25{\%} allele frequency ranges were assessed in 488 formalin-fixed tumours from the pilot phase of the Cancer 2015 cohort. All blocks were less than 2.5 years of age (mean 93 days). Results: Consistent with the signature of DNA damage due to formalin fixation, many formalin-fixed samples displayed disproportionate levels of C{\textgreater}T/G{\textgreater}A changes in the 1-10{\%} allele frequency range. Artefacts were less apparent in the 10-25{\%} allele frequency range. Significantly, changes were inversely correlated with coverage indicating high levels of sequencing artefacts were associated with samples with low amounts of available amplifiable template due to fragmentation. The degree of fragmentation and sequencing artefacts differed between blocks sourced from different anatomical pathology laboratories. In a limited validation of potentially actionable low frequency mutations, a NRAS G12D mutation in a melanoma was shown to be a false positive. Conclusions: These findings indicate that DNA damage following formalin fixation remains a major challenge in laboratories working with MPS. Methodologies that assess, minimise or remove formalin-induced DNA damaged templates as part of MPS protocols will aid in the interpretation of genomic results leading to better patient outcomes.},

abstract = {Motivation: Eugene Myers in his string graph paper (Myers, 2005) suggested that in a string graph or equivalently a unitig graph, any path spells a valid assembly. As a string/unitig graph also encodes every valid assembly of reads, such a graph, provided that it can be constructed correctly, is in fact a lossless representation of reads. In principle, every analysis based on whole-genome shotgun sequencing (WGS) data, such as SNP and insertion/deletion (INDEL) calling, can also be achieved with unitigs. Results: To explore the feasibility of using de novo assembly in the context of resequencing, we developed a de novo assembler, fermi, that assembles Illumina short reads into unitigs while preserving most of information of the input reads. SNPs and INDELs can be called by mapping the unitigs against a reference genome. By applying the method on 35-fold human resequencing data, we showed that in comparison to the standard pipeline, our approach yields similar accuracy for SNP calling and better results for INDEL calling. It has higher sensitivity than other de novo assembly based methods for variant calling. Our work suggests that variant calling with de novo assembly be a beneficial complement to the standard variant calling pipeline for whole-genome resequencing. In the methodological aspects, we proposed FMD-index for forward-backward extension of DNA sequences, a fast algorithm for finding all super-maximal exact matches and one-pass construction of unitigs from an FMD-index.

abstract = {BACKGROUND The diversity of clinical tumor profiling approaches (small panels to whole exomes with matched or unmatched germline analysis) may engender uncertainty about their benefits and liabilities, particularly in light of reported germline false positives in tumor-only profiling and use of global mutational and/or neoantigen data. The goal of this study was to determine the impact of genomic analysis strategies on error rates and data interpretation across contexts and ancestries. METHODS We modeled common tumor profiling modalities-large (n = 300 genes), medium (n = 48 genes), and small (n = 15 genes) panels-using clinical whole exomes (WES) from 157 patients with lung or colon adenocarcinoma. We created a tumor-only analysis algorithm to assess germline false positive rates, the impact of patient ancestry on tumor-only results, and neoantigen detection. RESULTS After optimizing a germline filtering strategy, the germline false positive rate with tumor-only large panel sequencing was 14 {\%} (144/1012 variants). For patients whose tumor-only results underwent molecular pathologist review (n = 91), 50/54 (93 {\%}) false positives were correctly interpreted as uncertain variants. Increased germline false positives were observed in tumor-only sequencing of non-European compared with European ancestry patients (p {\textless} 0.001; Fisher's exact) when basic germline filtering approaches were used; however, the ExAC database (60,706 germline exomes) mitigated this disparity (p = 0.53). Matched and unmatched large panel mutational load correlated with WES mutational load (r(2) = 0.99 and 0.93, respectively; p {\textless} 0.001). Neoantigen load also correlated (r(2) = 0.80; p {\textless} 0.001), though WES identified a broader spectrum of neoantigens. Small panels did not predict mutational or neoantigen load. CONCLUSIONS Large tumor-only targeted panels are sufficient for most somatic variant identification and mutational load prediction if paired with expanded germline analysis strategies and molecular pathologist review. Paired germline sequencing reduced overall false positive mutation calls and WES provided the most neoantigens. Without patient-matched germline data, large germline databases are needed to minimize false positive mutation calling and mitigate ethnic disparities.},

abstract = {The Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) is a rare, dominantly inherited syndrome that features high risk of cancers in childhood and early adulthood. Affected families tend to develop bone and soft tissue sarcomas, breast cancers, brain tumors, leukemias, and adrenocortical carcinomas. In some kindreds, the genetic abnormality associated with this cancer phenotype is a heterozygous germline mutation in the p53 tumor suppressor gene. Recently, we identified one patient who presented in early childhood with multiple primary cancers and who harbored three germline p53 alterations (R156H and R267Q on the maternal allele and R290H on the paternal allele). To classify the biologic effects of these alterations, functional properties of each of the p53 mutants were examined using in vitro assays of cellular growth suppression and transcriptional activation. Each amino acid substitution conferred partial or complete loss of wild-type p53 function, but the child completed normal embryonic development. This observation has not been previously reported in a human, but is consistent with observations of normal embryogenesis in p53-deficient mice.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: It remains a challenge to predict which women with axillary node-negative (ANN) breast cancer at greatest risk of relapse may benefit most from adjuvant therapy. Increases in neu/erbB-2 have been implicated in breast cancer prognosis. Although overexpression has been investigated extensively, this study represents the first prospective assessment of the prognostic value of neu/erbB-2 DNA amplification in a cohort of women with newly diagnosed ANN. METHODS: A consecutive series of women was monitored for recurrence (median follow-up duration, 36 months) and tumors from 580 individuals were analyzed for amplification. The association of amplification with risk of recurrence was examined in survival analyses with traditional and histologic markers as prognostic factors. RESULTS: Neu/erbB-2 was amplified in 20{\%} of cases. We found an increased risk of disease recurrence when neu/erbB-2 was amplified {\textgreater} or = twofold that persisted with adjustment for other prognostic factors (relative risk, 2.36; P = .002). We found some evidence that amplification was more important in patients who received chemotherapy compared with untreated patients. CONCLUSION: neu/erbB-2 amplification is an independent prognostic factor for risk of recurrence in ANN breast cancer. Women with tumors without neu/erbB-2 amplification have a good prognosis; aggressive therapy in this group is therefore difficult to justify. On the other hand, even with adjuvant chemotherapeutic treatment, women whose tumors exhibit neu/erbB-2 amplification have an increased risk of recurrence. We encourage a randomized trial to compare more aggressive adjuvant chemotherapy versus standard chemotherapy for ANN women whose tumors exhibit neu/erbB-2 amplification.},

abstract = {Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) is the initial and rate-limiting enzyme of the uracil catabolic pathway, being critically important for inactivation of the commonly prescribed anti-cancer drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). DPD impairment leads to increased exposure to 5-FU and, in turn, increased anabolism of 5-FU to cytotoxic nucleotides, resulting in more severe clinical adverse effects. Numerous variants within the gene coding for DPD, DPYD, have been described, although only a few have been demonstrated to reduce DPD enzyme activity. To identify DPYD variants that alter enzyme function, we expressed 80 protein-coding variants in an isogenic mammalian system and measured their capacities to convert 5-FU to dihydro-fluorouracil, the product of DPD catabolism. The M166V, E828K, K861R, and P1023T variants exhibited significantly higher enzyme activity than wild-type DPD (120{\%}, P = 0.025; 116{\%}, P = 0.049; 130{\%}, P = 0.0077; 138{\%}, P = 0.048, respectively). Consistent with clinical association studies of 5-FU toxicity, the D949V substitution reduced enzyme activity by 41{\%} (P = 0.0031). Enzyme activity was also significantly reduced for 30 additional variants, 19 of which had {\textless}25{\%} activity. None of those 30 variants have been previously reported to associate with 5-FU toxicity in clinical association studies, which have been conducted primarily in populations of European ancestry. Using publicly available genotype databases, we confirmed the rarity of these variants in European populations but showed that they are detected at appreciable frequencies in other populations. These data strongly suggest that testing for the reported deficient DPYD variations could dramatically improve predictive genetic tests for 5-FU sensitivity, especially in individuals of non-European descent.},

The four tools returned poor consensus on candidates (only 20{\%} of calls were with multiple hits by the callers). For both WES and UDT-Seq, MuTect2 and Strelka obtained the largest proportion of COSMIC entries as well as the lowest rate of dbSNP presence and high-alternative-alleles-in-control calls, demonstrating their superior sensitivity and accuracy. Combining different callers does increase reliability of candidates, but narrows the list down to very limited range of tumor read depth and variant allele frequency. Calling SNV on UDT-Seq data, which were of much higher read-depth, discovered additional true-positive variations, despite an even more tremendous growth in false positive predictions. Our findings not only provide valuable benchmark for state-of-the-art SNV calling methods, but also shed light on the access to more accurate SNV identification in the future.},

abstract = {DNA isolated from paraffin-embedded tissues has been used for analysis of DNA alterations in disease states. Use of archival tissue can expedite the gathering of large numbers of specimens from rare disease subtypes that would take years to accumulate prospectively. Therefore, archival tissues from 70 ovarian cancer cases diagnosed before or at age 40 were retrieved for analysis of BRCA1 mutations. DNA was isolated from paraffin-embedded tissue of 70 ovarian cancer cases diagnosed before or at age 40. BRCA1 mutation analysis was conducted by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and DNA sequencing. Fifty-eight BRCA1 mutations were found in 34 of the 70 ovarian cancer cases. Twenty-two cases had one mutation each and 12 cases had multiple mutations. Multiple mutations found in histologically normal tissue of 2 cases were not present in matched tumor tissue. For another case, DNA from two separate blocks of normal tissue contained different mutations. These observations were anomalous and suggested that mutations detected in fixed tissues may be artifacts of tissue preservation and not present in the original unfixed tissues. To test this suggestion, blood was obtained from 2 patients for whom mutations were found in fixed, normal tissue. DNA from their unfixed lymphocytes did not contain the mutations found in fixed normal tissue. Thus, mutations found in fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues can be artifacts of tissue preservation. The reliability of DNA sequence data derived from such tissues must be questioned in the absence of corroborating data from unfixed tissues. This severely limits the use of fixed tissues as a source of DNA for retrospective research and for clinical genetic testing in families for which a disease-affected member is not alive.},

However, there is no biomarker that could be used to predict the clinical response of paclitaxel. This work was conducted to investigate the association of genetic polymorphisms in FBW7 and its substrate genes and the clinical response of paclitaxel. Patients with advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma were treated with paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 over 3 hours day 1 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 day 1, every 3 weeks. The genotypes of 11 FBW7 and its substrate gene polymorphisms were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Statistical analysis revealed that patients with mTOR rs1057079 AG (ORadjusted: 4.59; 95{\%} CI: 1.78-11.86) genotype had significant correlation with the clinical response of paclitaxel when compared with AA genotype after adjustment for sex, age, and chemotherapy cycle. The median progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with advanced ESCC who received paclitaxel plus cisplatin (TP) as first-line treatment is 14.3 months (95{\%} CI: 9.0-19.60 months).

abstract = {Liver cancer has the second highest worldwide cancer mortality rate and has limited therapeutic options. We analyzed 363 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases by whole-exome sequencing and DNA copy number analyses, and we analyzed 196 HCC cases by DNA methylation, RNA, miRNA, and proteomic expression also. DNA sequencing and mutation analysis identified significantly mutated genes, including LZTR1, EEF1A1, SF3B1, and SMARCA4. Significant alterations by mutation or downregulation by hypermethylation in genes likely to result in HCC metabolic reprogramming (ALB, APOB, and CPS1) were observed. Integrative molecular HCC subtyping incorporating unsupervised clustering of five data platforms identified three subtypes, one of which was associated with poorer prognosis in three HCC cohorts. Integrated analyses enabled development of a p53 target gene expression signature correlating with poor survival. Potential therapeutic targets for which inhibitors exist include WNT signaling, MDM4, MET, VEGFA, MCL1, IDH1, TERT, and immune checkpoint proteins CTLA-4, PD-1, and PD-L1.},

abstract = {Individuals who inherit mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 are predisposed to breast and ovarian cancers. However, identifying mutations in these large genes by conventional dideoxy sequencing in a clinical testing laboratory is both time consuming and costly, and similar challenges exist for other large genes, or sets of genes, with relevance in the clinical setting. Second-generation sequencing technologies have the potential to improve the efficiency and throughput of clinical diagnostic sequencing, once clinically validated methods become available. We have developed a method for detection of variants based on automated small-amplicon PCR followed by sample pooling and sequencing with a second-generation instrument. To demonstrate the suitability of this method for clinical diagnostic sequencing, we analyzed the coding exons and the intron-exon boundaries of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in 91 hereditary breast cancer patient samples. Our method generated high-quality sequence coverage across all targeted regions, with median coverage greater than 4000-fold for each sample in pools of 24. Sensitive and specific automated variant detection, without false-positive or false-negative results, was accomplished with a standard software pipeline using bwa for sequence alignment and samtools for variant detection. We experimentally derived a minimum threshold of 100-fold sequence depth for confident variant detection. The results demonstrate that this method is suitable for sensitive, automatable, high-throughput sequence variant detection in the clinical laboratory.

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether specific combinations of polymorphisms in genes encoding proteins involved in 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are associated with increased risk of treatment-induced toxicity.$\backslash$nExperimental Design: We analyzed two cohorts of 161 and 340 patients, the exploration and validation cohort, respectively. All patients were treated similarly with 5-FU–based adjuvant chemotherapy. We analyzed 13 functional polymorphisms and applied a four-fold analysis strategy using individual polymorphisms, haplotypes, and phenotypic enzyme activity or expression classifications based on combinations of functional polymorphisms in specific genes. Furthermore, multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis was used to identify a genetic interaction profile indicating an increased risk of toxicity.$\backslash$nResults: Alleles associated with low activity of methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) were associated with decreased risk of toxicity [ORExploration 0.39 (95{\%} CI: 0.21–0.71, P = 0.003), ORValidation 0.63 (95{\%} CI: 0.41–0.95, P = 0.03)]. A specific combination of the MTHFR 1298A{\textgreater}C and thymidylate synthase (TYMS) 3′-UTR (untranslated region) ins/del polymorphisms was significantly associated with increased toxicity in both cohorts [ORExploration 2.40 (95{\%} CI: 1.33–4.29, P = 0.003), ORValidation 1.81 (95{\%} CI: 1.18–2.79, P = 0.007)]. The specific combination was also associated with increased cumulative incidence and earlier occurrence of severe toxicity during treatment.$\backslash$nConclusions: Our results indicate that MTHFR activity and a specific combination of the MTHFR 1298A{\textgreater}C and TYMS 3′-UTR ins/del polymorphisms are possible predictors of 5-FU treatment–related toxicity.

abstract = {PURPOSE: Although single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of the dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase gene (DPYD) have been reported, which affect enzyme activity and the severity of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) toxicity, no pretherapeutic detection has thus far been developed. We investigated 22 DPYD gene SNPs, their respective incidence, their link with grade 3 to 4 toxic side effects, and their management in practice: 9 were looked for in 487 patients, whereas 13 others were investigated in 171 patients.$\backslash$nPATIENTS AND METHODS: SNPs were detected before 5-FU-based treatment in WBC using a Pyrosequencing method. Close clinical and biological follow-up was done.$\backslash$nRESULTS: Five different SNPs were found in 187 patients (IVS14 + 1G{\textgreater}A, 2846A{\textgreater}T, 1679T{\textgreater}G, 85T{\textgreater}C, -1590T{\textgreater}C). Three hundred patients had no SNP. Forty-four patients had grade 3 to 4 toxic side effects in either the first or second cycle. Sixty percent of patients with either IVS14 + 1G{\textgreater}A or 2846A{\textgreater}T SNPs and the only patient with 1679T{\textgreater}G SNP experienced early grade 3 to 4 toxicity, compared with 0{\%}, 5.5{\%}, and 15{\%} of those with either -1590T{\textgreater}C, 85T{\textgreater}C SNP, or no SNP, respectively. In cases with grade 3 to 4 toxicity, treatment either had to be quickly stopped, or could be safely continued with an individual dose adjustment. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the detection of these three major SNPs as toxicity predictive factors were 0.31, 0.98, and 0.62 and 0.94, respectively.$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Pretreatment detection of three DPYD SNPs could help to avoid severe toxic side effects. This approach is suitable for clinical practice and should be compared or combined with pharmacologic approaches. In the case of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency, 5-FU administration often can be safely continued with an individual dose adjustment.},

abstract = {Deamination of nucleotides causes C:G{\textgreater}T:A changes in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples and produces false positives during next-generation sequencing (NGS). Uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) helps eliminate this issue, but the effect of UDG in different tissue preparation conditions has not been rigorously studied. To investigate whether UDG can reduce false-positive single-nucleotide variant (SNV) calls, we used tumor and normal tissues from gastric adenocarcinoma patients prepared using different fixation times and pH conditions. FFPE tumor blocks {\textgreater}10 years were also evaluated for the comparison. We performed semiconductor-based NGS to evaluate nucleotide changes and used UDG to test deamination-related effects. Sequencing quality parameters mildly worsened with prolonged fixation time, acidic pH, and delayed fixation. SNV calls and C:G{\textgreater}T:A changes increased after {\textgreater}48 hours of fixation. In both recently prepared and old FFPE tissue blocks, UDG treatment reduced deamination-induced nucleotide changes. In the recently prepared samples, both high-quality SNVs and mean target coverage were remarkably increased on treatment with UDG. However, the quality of NGS results from old-age samples varied irrespective of UDG treatment. In conclusion, based on our findings, we believe that when performing NGS on recently embedded blocks, it is important to consider that certain poorly fixed samples may be at the risk of being deaminated, which can be corrected with UDG treatment.},

abstract = {Background: Individuals with Li-Fraumeni syndrome have a high lifetime risk of developing cancer. We assessed the feasibility and potential clinical effect of a comprehensive surveillance protocol in asymptomatic TP53 mutation carriers in families with this syndrome. Methods: We implemented a clinical surveillance protocol, using frequent biochemical and imaging studies, for asymptomatic TP53 mutation carriers on Jan 1, 2004, and did a prospective observational study of members of eight families with Li-Fraumeni syndrome who either chose to undergo surveillance or chose not to undergo surveillance. The primary outcome measure was detection of new cancers. The secondary outcome measure was overall survival. Findings: As of Nov 1, 2010, 33 TP53 mutation carriers were identified, 18 of whom underwent surveillance. The surveillance protocol detected ten asymptomatic tumours in seven patients, including small, high-grade tumours and low-grade or premalignant tumours. All seven mutation carriers were alive after a median follow-up of 24 months (IQR 22-65 months). 12 high-grade, high-stage tumours developed in 10 individuals in the non-surveillance group, two of whom (20{\%}) were alive at the end of follow-up (p=0{\textperiodcentered}0417 for comparison with survival in the surveillance group). 3-year overall survival was 100{\%} in the surveillance group and 21{\%} (95{\%} CI 4-48{\%}) in the non-surveillance group (p=0{\textperiodcentered}0155). Interpretation: Our findings show the feasibility of a clinical surveillance protocol for the detection of asymptomatic neoplasms in individuals with germline TP53 mutations. This strategy offers a management option for affected individuals, and its benefits lend support to the use of early genetic testing of at-risk individuals and families.

abstract = {Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has revolutionized genomic research by decreasing the cost of sequencing while increasing the throughput. The focus now is on potential clinical applications of NGS technology for diagnostics and therapeutics. Clinical applications of NGS in cancer can detect clinically actionable genetic/genomic alterations that are critical for cancer care. These alterations can be of diagnostic, prognostic, or therapeutic significance. In certain cancers, patient risk and prognosis can be predicted based on the mutation profile identified by NGS. Many targeted therapies have been developed for cancer patients who bear specific mutations; however, choosing the right NGS technique for the appropriate clinical application can be challenging, especially in clinical oncology, where the material for NGS tests is often limited and the turnaround time (TAT) for cancer tests is constrained to a few days. Currently, amplicon-based NGS approaches have emerged as the best fit for clinical oncology. In this review, we focus on amplicon-based library preparation, sequencing, sequence data alignment and annotation, and post-analytic interpretation and reporting. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Uterine serous carcinoma (USC) is not recognized as part of any defined hereditary cancer syndrome, and its association with hereditary breast and ovarian carcinoma and Lynch syndrome are uncertain.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Using targeted capture and massively parallel genomic sequencing, 151 subjects with USC were assessed for germline mutations in 30 tumor suppressor genes, including BRCA1 (breast cancer 1, early onset), BRCA2, the DNA mismatch repair genes (MLH1 [mutL homolog 1], MSH2 [mutS homolog 2], MSH6, PMS2 [postmeiotic segregation increased 2]), TP53 (tumor protein p53), and 10 other genes in the Fanconi anemia-BRCA pathway. Ten cases with {\textless} 10{\%} serous histology were also assessed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Seven subjects (4.6{\%}) carried germline loss-of-function mutations: 3 subjects (2.0{\%}) with mutations in BRCA1, 2 subjects (1.3{\%}) with mutations in TP53, and 2 subjects (1.3{\%}) with mutations in CHEK2 (checkpoint kinase 2). One subject with {\textless} 10{\%} serous histology had an MSH6 mutation. Subjects with MSH6 and TP53 mutations had neither personal nor family histories suggestive of Lynch or Li-Fraumeni syndromes. Of the 22 women with USC and a personal history of breast carcinoma, the frequency of BRCA1 mutations was 9{\%}, compared to 0.9{\%} in 119 women with no such history.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Approximately 5{\%} of women with USC have germline mutations in 3 different tumor suppressor genes: BRCA1, CHEK2, and TP53. Mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes that cause Lynch syndrome are rare in USC. The germline BRCA1 mutation rate in USC subjects of 2{\%} is higher than expected in a nonfounder population, suggesting that USC is associated with hereditary breast and ovarian carcinoma in a small proportion of cases. Women with USC and breast cancer should be offered genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations.},

abstract = {In this marker evaluation study, we tested whether distinct patterns of functional genomic polymorphisms in genes involved in drug metabolic pathways and DNA repair that predict clinical outcome to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/oxaliplatin chemotherapy in patients with advanced colorectal cancer could be identified. Functional polymorphisms in DNA-repair genes XPD, ERCC1, XRCC1, XPA, and metabolising genes glutathione S-transferase GSTP1, GSTT1, GSTM1, and thymidylate synthase (TS) were assessed retrospectively in 106 patients with refractory stage IV disease who received 5-FU/oxaliplatin combination chemotherapy, using a polymerase chain reaction-based RFLP technique. Favourable genotypes from polymorphisms in XPD-751, ERCC1-118, GSTP1-105, and TS-3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) that are associated with overall survival were identified. After adjustment for performance status, the relative risks of dying for patients who possessed the unfavourable genotype were: 3.33 for XPD-751 (P=0.037), 3.25 for GSTP1-105 (P=0.072), 2.05 for ERCC1-118 (P=0.037), and 1.65 for TS-3'UTR (P=0.091) when compared to their respective beneficial genomic variants. Combination analysis with all four polymorphisms revealed that patients possessing {\textgreater} or =2 favourable genotypes survived a median of 17.4 months (95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 9.4, 26.5) compared to 5.4 months (95{\%} CI: 4.3, 6.0) in patients with no favourable genotype. Patients who carried one favourable genotype demonstrated intermediate survival of 10.2 months (95{\%} CI: 6.8, 15.3; P{\textless}0.001). Polymorphisms in the TS-3'UTR and GSTP1-105 gene were also associated with time to progression. After adjustment for performance status, patients with an unfavourable TS-3'UTR genotype had a relative risk of disease progression of 1.76 (P=0.020) and those with the unfavourable GSTP1-105 genotype showed a relative risk of progression of 2.00 (P=0.018). The genomic polymorphisms XPD-751, ERCC1-118, GSTP1-105, and TS-3'UTR may be useful in predicting overall survival and time to progression of colorectal cancer in patients who receive 5-FU/oxaliplatin chemotherapy. These findings require independent prospective confirmation.},

With these potential advantages in mind, we here evaluate the utility of the Pacific Biosciences RS platform for human medical amplicon resequencing projects. RESULTS: We evaluated the Pacific Biosciences technology for SNP discovery in medical resequencing projects using the Genome Analysis Toolkit, observing high sensitivity and specificity for calling differences in amplicons containing known true or false SNPs. We assessed data quality: most errors were indels ({\~{}}14{\%}) with few apparent miscalls ({\~{}}1{\%}). In this work, we define a custom data processing pipeline for Pacific Biosciences data for human data analysis. CONCLUSION: Critically, the error properties were largely free of the context-specific effects that affect other sequencing technologies. These data show excellent utility for follow-up validation and extension studies in human data and medical genetics projects, but can be extended to other organisms with a reference genome.},

abstract = {Formalin fixing with paraffin embedding (FFPE) has been a standard sample preparation method for decades, and archival FFPE samples are still very useful resources. Nonetheless, the use of FFPE samples in cancer genome analysis using next-generation sequencing, which is a powerful technique for the identification of genomic alterations at the nucleotide level, has been challenging due to poor DNA quality and artificial sequence alterations. In this study, we performed whole-exome sequencing of matched frozen samples and FFPE samples of tissues from 4 cancer patients and compared the next-generation sequencing data obtained from these samples. The major differences between data obtained from the 2 types of sample were the shorter insert size and artificial base alterations in the FFPE samples. A high proportion of short inserts in the FFPE samples resulted in overlapping paired reads, which could lead to overestimation of certain variants; {\textgreater}20{\%} of the inserts in the FFPE samples were double sequenced. A large number of soft clipped reads was found in the sequencing data of the FFPE samples, and about 30{\%} of total bases were soft clipped. The artificial base alterations, C{\textgreater}T and G{\textgreater}A, were observed in FFPE samples only, and the alteration rate ranged from 200 to 1,200 per 1M bases when sequencing errors were removed. Although high-confidence mutation calls in the FFPE samples were compatible to that in the frozen samples, caution should be exercised in terms of the artifacts, especially for low-confidence calls. Despite the clearly observed artifacts, archival FFPE samples can be a good resource for discovery or validation of biomarkers in cancer research based on whole-exome sequencing.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is involved in the development and progression of lung cancer. Somatic EGFR mutations are predictors of response to treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitors (TKIs) for lung cancer, especially among never smokers. EGFR mutations may occur independently of other genetic alterations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The authors sequenced the EGFR-TK domain and the K-ras and p53 genes from lung tumor tissues from 44 never smokers and 46 smokers. A case-control study also was conducted to examine the relationship between an EGFR single nucleotide polymorphism in the TK domain and the lung cancer through a multivariate logistic regression analysis. In addition, the authors compared cell growth kinetics, EGFR-TKI sensitivity by MTT, and activation of signaling molecules by immunoblot in lung cancer cell lines with and without EGFR-TK mutations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: EGFR-TK mutations were more frequently observed in never smokers (25{\%}) than in smokers (2.2{\%}) (p = 0.001). Excluding cases with a K-ras mutation, the frequency of EGFR-TK domain mutation was still significantly higher in never smokers than in smokers, 26.2{\%} versus 4.5{\%} (p = 0.046). EGFR-TK mutations and K-ras mutations (p = 0.015), and p53 and K-ras mutations (p = 0.015) were mutually exclusive, but p53 and EGFR-TK mutations were not (p = 1.00). During sequencing of the EGFR-TK domain in tumors, an EGFR polymorphism (G2607A) was identified. The genotype AA and AA + AG occurred at a significantly higher frequency in lung cancer cases (n = 122) when compared with controls (n = 147) (odds ratio, 3.39 and 2.67; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.41-8.17 and 1.17-6.08, p = 0.006 and p = 0.02, respectively). This polymorphism was found independently of EGFR-TK mutations in lung cancer cases, indicating that it does not predispose to mutations. In vitro, lung cancer cell lines with EGFR-TK mutations also did not contain K-ras mutations and displayed a lower growth rate (50{\%}, p = 0.013) than EGFR-TK wild-type cell lines. EGFR-TK mutant cell lines were more sensitive to both gefitinib and erlotinib, although relative sensitivity to erlotinib compared with wild-type was less pronounced than for gefitinib. Cell lines with a lower growth rate also expressed higher levels of E-cadherin than faster growing cell lines.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: EGFR-TK mutation frequency is high in never-smoking lung cancer patients and is exclusive of mutation in K-ras but not p53. In addition to somatic EGFR-TK mutations that arise in lung tumors, germline variation in the EGFR-TK domain might also be associated with an increased risk of lung cancer. Somatic EGFR-TK mutations alter cell biology and response to EGFR-TKIs and may be mutation specific.},

Most NGS studies use DNA isolated from whole blood or fresh frozen tissue. However, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues are one of the most widely available clinical specimens. Their potential utility as a source of DNA for NGS would greatly enhance population-based cancer studies. While preliminary studies suggest FFPE tissue may be used for NGS, the feasibility of using archived FFPE specimens in population based studies and the effect of storage time on these specimens needs to be determined. We conducted a study to determine whether DNA in archived FFPE high-grade ovarian serous adenocarcinomas from Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registries Residual Tissue Repositories (RTR) was present in sufficient quantity and quality for NGS assays. Fifty-nine FFPE tissues, stored from 3 to 32 years, were obtained from three SEER RTR sites. DNA was extracted, quantified, quality assessed, and subjected to whole exome sequencing (WES). Following DNA extraction, 58 of 59 specimens (98{\%}) yielded DNA and moved on to the library generation step followed by WES. Specimens stored for longer periods of time had significantly lower coverage of the target region (6{\%} lower per 10 years, 95{\%} CI: 3-10{\%}) and lower average read depth (40x lower per 10 years, 95{\%} CI: 18-60), although sufficient quality and quantity of WES data was obtained for data mining. Overall, 90{\%} (53/59) of specimens provided usable NGS data regardless of storage time. This feasibility study demonstrates FFPE specimens acquired from SEER registries after varying lengths of storage time and under varying storage conditions are a promising source of DNA for NGS.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Advances in high-throughput genotyping and next generation sequencing have generated a vast amount of human genetic variation data. Single nucleotide substitutions within protein coding regions are of particular importance owing to their potential to give rise to amino acid substitutions that affect protein structure and function which may ultimately lead to a disease state. Over the last decade, a number of computational methods have been developed to predict whether such amino acid substitutions result in an altered phenotype. Although these methods are useful in practice, and accurate for their intended purpose, they are not well suited for providing probabilistic estimates of the underlying disease mechanism. RESULTS: We have developed a new computational model, MutPred, that is based upon protein sequence, and which models changes of structural features and functional sites between wild-type and mutant sequences. These changes, expressed as probabilities of gain or loss of structure and function, can provide insight into the specific molecular mechanism responsible for the disease state. MutPred also builds on the established SIFT method but offers improved classification accuracy with respect to human disease mutations. Given conservative thresholds on the predicted disruption of molecular function, we propose that MutPred can generate accurate and reliable hypotheses on the molecular basis of disease for approximately 11{\%} of known inherited disease-causing mutations. We also note that the proportion of changes of functionally relevant residues in the sets of cancer-associated somatic mutations is higher than for the inherited lesions in the Human Gene Mutation Database which are instead predicted to be characterized by disruptions of protein structure.

To evaluate the importance of this specific type of inborn error of pyrimidine metabolism in the etiology of 5FU toxicity, an analysis of the DPD activity, the DPD gene, and the clinical presentation of patients suffering from severe toxicity after the administration of 5FU was performed. Our study demonstrated that in 59{\%} of the cases, a decreased DPD activity could be detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. It was observed that 55{\%} of patients with a decreased DPD activity suffered from grade IV neutropenia compared with 13{\%} of patients with a normal DPD activity (P = 0.01). Furthermore, the onset of toxicity occurred, on average, twice as fast in patients with low DPD activity as compared with patients with a normal DPD activity (10.0 +/- 7.6 versus 19.1 +/- 15.3 days; P {\textless} 0.05). Analysis of the DPD gene of 14 patients with a reduced DPD activity revealed the presence of mutations in 11 of 14 patients, with the splice site mutation IVS14+1G--{\textgreater}A being the most abundant one (6 of 14 patients; 43{\%}). Two novel missense mutations 496A--{\textgreater}G (M166V) and 2846A--{\textgreater}T (D949V) were detected in exon 6 and exon 22, respectively. Our results demonstrated that at least 57{\%} (8 of 14) of the patients with a reduced DPD activity have a molecular basis for their deficient phenotype.},

abstract = {Pre-therapeutic DPYD pharmacogenetic test to prevent fluoropyrimidines (FL)-related toxicities is not yet common practice in medical oncology. We aimed at investigating the clinical validity of DPYD genetic analysis in a large series of oncological patients. Six hundred three cancer patients, treated with FL, have been retrospectively tested for eight DPYD polymorphisms (DPYD-rs3918290, DPYD-rs55886062, DPYD-rs67376798, DPYD-rs2297595, DPYD-rs1801160, DPYD-rs1801158, DPYD-rs1801159, DPYD-rs17376848) for association with Grade ≥3 toxicity, developed within the first three cycles of therapy. DPYD-rs3918290 and DPYD-rs67376798 were associated to Grade ≥3 toxicity after bootstrap validation and Bonferroni correction (p = 0.003, p = 0.048). DPYD-rs55886062 was not significant likely due to its low allelic frequency, nonetheless one out of two heterozygous patients (compound heterozygous with DPYD-rs3918290) died from toxicity after one cycle. Test specificity for the analysis of DPYD-rs3918290, DPYD-rs55886062 and DPYD-rs67376798 was assessed to 99{\%}. Among the seven patients carrying one variant DPYD-rs3918290, DPYD-rs55886062 or DPYD-rs67376798 allele, not developing Grade ≥3 toxicity, 57{\%} needed a FL dose or schedule modification for moderate chronic toxicity. No other DPYD polymorphism was associated with Grade ≥3 toxicity. Our data demonstrate the clinical validity and specificity of the DPYD-rs3918290, DPYD-rs55886062, DPYD-rs67376798 genotyping test to prevent FL-related Grade ≥3 toxicity and to preserve treatment compliance, and support its introduction in the clinical practice.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: Ewing sarcoma is a primary bone tumor initiated by EWSR1-ETS gene fusions. To identify secondary genetic lesions that contribute to tumor progression, we performed whole-genome sequencing of 112 Ewing sarcoma samples and matched germline DNA. Overall, Ewing sarcoma tumors had relatively few single-nucleotide variants, indels, structural variants, and copy-number alterations. Apart from whole chromosome arm copy-number changes, the most common somatic mutations were detected in STAG2 (17{\%}), CDKN2A (12{\%}), TP53 (7{\%}), EZH2, BCOR, and ZMYM3 (2.7{\%} each). Strikingly, STAG2 mutations and CDKN2A deletions were mutually exclusive, as confirmed in Ewing sarcoma cell lines. In an expanded cohort of 299 patients with clinical data, we discovered that STAG2 and TP53 mutations are often concurrent and are associated with poor outcome. Finally, we detected subclonal STAG2 mutations in diagnostic tumors and expansion of STAG2-immunonegative cells in relapsed tumors as compared with matched diagnostic samples. SIGNIFICANCE: Whole-genome sequencing reveals that the somatic mutation rate in Ewing sarcoma is low. Tumors that harbor STAG2 and TP53 mutations have a particularly dismal prognosis with current treatments and require alternative therapies. Novel drugs that target epigenetic regulators may constitute viable therapeutic strategies in a subset of patients with mutations in chromatin modifiers.},

abstract = {Objective: Conventional therapies are still unsuccessful in patients with carcinoma arising from the biliary tract. Somatic mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene and the activation of its downstream pathways predict the sensitivity to small-molecule inhibitors in non–small cell lung carcinoma. Therefore, we analyzed EGFR mutations and related pathways in gallbladder and bile duct carcinomas to consider the possible application of these alternative therapeutic strategies.$\backslash$nExperimental Design: Forty paraffin-embedded samples, including intrahepatic or extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder carcinoma, were studied after tumor cell isolation by laser microdissection and sequencing of EGFR tyrosine kinase domain (exons 18-21). Activation of EGFR pathway was studied by evaluating phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt.$\backslash$nResults: None of the 40 specimens had mutations in exon 18; one had one missense point mutation in exon 19, two in exon 20, and three in exon 21. In addition, 36 of 40 specimens had the same silent mutation at codon 787 in exon 20, which was also found in peripheral blood cells from healthy donors. Tumor samples harboring EGFR mutation had phosphorylation of one or both downstream transducers analyzed.$\backslash$nConclusions: This is the first evidence of somatic mutations of the EGFR gene in bile duct carcinoma. Our findings suggest that a subgroup of patients with cholangiocarcinoma or gallbladder carcinoma exhibits somatic mutations of EGFR in the tyrosine kinase domain that can elicit cell signals sustaining survival and proliferation. These tumors might be further evaluated for their susceptibility to small-molecule inhibitor treatment.},

abstract = {A pharmacogenetic syndrome caused by molecular defects in the dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase gene (DPYD ) results in partial to complete loss of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) enzyme activity with patients exhibiting life-threatening toxicity following administration of routine doses of 5-fluorouracil. To date, more than 19 reported mutations have been putatively associated with DPD deficiency with 16 occurring within the open reading frame of the cDNA. The purpose of this study was to examine the conservation of functional domains (including the uracil, flavine adenine dinucleotide and NADPH binding sites) across three phyla (Chordata, Arthropoda and Nematoda) and the conservation of regions corresponding to the previously reported mutations. Comparative analysis of the uracil and NADPH binding sites in mammals and invertebrates demonstrated 100{\%} amino acid identity between mammals and Drosophila melanogaster. Caenorhabditis elegans demonstrated 89{\%} and 88{\%} identity in these domains, respectively. The mammalian sequences demonstrated 100{\%} identity in two iron sulphur motifs (amino acids 953-964 and 986-997) with significant conservation in D. melanogaster (92{\%} and 92{\%} identity, respectively) and C. elegans (100{\%} and 92{\%} identity, respectively). Comparative amino acid analysis revealed non-conservation in the loci of four DPYD mutations [DPYD*12 (R21Q), DPYD*5 (I543V), DPYD*6 (V732I), DPYD*9A (C29R)]. Seven mutations occurred in highly conserved regions [M166V, DPYD*8 (R235W), DPYD*11 (V335l), DPYD*4 (S534N), DPYD*9B (R886H), D949V, DPYD*10 (V995F)]. In summary, this comparative analysis identified conserved regions which may be critical to enzyme structure and/or function. The conservation of loci where DPYD mutations occur was also examined to evaluate their functional significance on DPD enzyme activity. These data should prove useful in the evaluation of newly discovered mutations in the DPYD gene.},

abstract = {Tissues used for clinical diagnostics are mostly formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) which provides many advantages. However, the quality of the obtained nucleic acids (NA) is reduced and this turns out to be a challenge for further molecular analyses. Although the spectrum of analyses of NA extracted from FFPE tissue has increased, the standard operating procedures for NA isolation from old tissue blocks still need to be improved. Here, we compared the efficiency of different NA extraction methods, using FFPE tissues of variable age and origin, with respect to downstream analyses. Our study showed that the phenol-chloroform isoamyl alcohol (PCI) and the commercial Qiagen protocol yielded samples with highest purity. The PCI protocol delivered the longest amplicons even from samples from the 1970s. We developed a short (1 h) tissue lysis procedure that turned out to be highly time- and cost-effective when DNA quality was tested using single and multiplex PCR. Compared to a 1-day lysis-protocol, the amplicons were only 100 bp shorter. In addition, single-copy genes used in daily routine were successfully amplified from long-term stored FFPE samples following 1-h tissue-lysis. The RNA integrity numbers (RIN) determined on RNA isolated from FFPE tissues indicated degraded RNA; however, all RINs were above the generally agreed threshold of 1.4. We showed that, depending on the purpose of the analysis, NA retrieved from FFPE tissues older than 40 years may be successfully used for molecular analysis.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Certain rare, familial mutations in the ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2 or TP53 genes increase susceptibility to breast cancer but it has not, until now, been clear whether common polymorphic variants in the same genes also increase risk. METHODS: We have attempted a comprehensive, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)- and haplotype-tagging association study on each of these five genes in up to 4,474 breast cancer cases from the British, East Anglian SEARCH study and 4,560 controls from the EPIC-Norfolk study, using a two-stage study design. Nine tag SNPs were genotyped in ATM, together with five in BRCA1, sixteen in BRCA2, ten in CHEK2 and five in TP53, with the aim of tagging all other known, common variants. SNPs generating the common amino acid substitutions were specifically forced into the tagging set for each gene. RESULTS: No significant breast cancer associations were detected with any individual or combination of tag SNPs. CONCLUSION: It is unlikely that there are any other common variants in these genes conferring measurably increased risks of breast cancer in our study population.},

Sanger sequencing), the advent of massively parallel sequencing technologies became another biotechnical revolution that enables the acquisition of genetic information in gigabase scale within an acceptable period of time. As a consequence, causal mutations underlying clinically heterogeneous disorders are more effi ciently detected, paving the way for deciphering the pathogenecities of complex diseases. With the huge potential impact in modern medicine and health care, progress has been rapid in further optimizing the technology in both the academic and industrial fi elds. Third-generation sequencing technologies, although still facing multiple challenges, have shed light on the direct analyses of DNA and RNA at single- molecule level. Currently, before whole genome sequencing becomes routine, an in-depth assessment of targeted genomic regions is more feasible and has been widely applied in both clinical applications and basic research. Various enrichment methods, either PCR-based or hybridization-based, have been developed and gradu- ally improved during application. This chapter provides detailed information on various target gene enrichment methods as well as massively parallel sequencing platforms. Hopefully this could assist the project-based approach/platform selec- tions tailored for individual needs.},

abstract = {Li-Fraumeni syndrome, resulting from p53 (TP53) germline mutations, represents one of the most devastating genetic predispositions to cancer. Recently, the MDM2 SNP309 (T--{\textgreater}G variation) was shown to be associated with accelerated tumour formation in p53 mutation carriers. The impact of the common p53 codon 72 polymorphism on cancer risk remains controversial. We therefore investigated the effect of these two polymorphisms in 61 French carriers of the p53 germline mutation. The mean age of tumour onset in MDMD2 SNP309 G allele carriers (19.6 years) was significantly different from that observed in patients homozygous for the T allele (29.9 years, p{\textless}0.05). For the p53 codon 72 polymorphism, the mean age of tumour onset in Arg allele carriers (21.8 years) was also different from that of Pro/Pro patients (34.4 years, p{\textless}0.05). We observed a cumulative effect of both polymorphisms because the mean ages of tumour onset in carriers of the MDM2G and p53Arg alleles (16.9 years) and those with the MDM2T/T and p53Pro/Pro genotypes (43 years) were clearly different (p{\textless}0.02). Therefore, our results confirm the impact of the MDM2 SNP309 G allele on the age of tumour onset in germline p53 mutation carriers, and suggest that this effect may be amplified by the p53 72Arg allele. Polymorphisms affecting p53 degradation therefore represent one of the rare examples of modifier genetic factors identified to date in mendelian predispositions to cancer.},

The Philadelphia (Ph1) chromosome in all nine patients represents a deletion of the long arm of chromosome 22 (22q-)1,2. An unsuspected abnormality in all cells from the nine patients has been detected with these new staining techniques. It consists of the addition of dully fluorescing material to the end of the long arm of one chromosome 9 (9q+). In Giemsa-stained preparations, this material appears as an additional faint terminal band in one chromosome 9. The amount of additional material is approximately equal to the amount missing from the Ph1 (22q-) chromosome, suggesting that there may be a hitherto undetected translocation between the long arm of 22 and the long arm of 9, producing the 9q+ chromosome.},

Sequence data are obtained by directly sensing the ions produced by template-directed DNA polymerase synthesis using all-natural nucleotides on this massively parallel semiconductor-sensing device or ion chip. The ion chip contains ion-sensitive, field-effect transistor-based sensors in perfect register with 1.2 million wells, which provide confinement and allow parallel, simultaneous detection of independent sequencing reactions. Use of the most widely used technology for constructing integrated circuits, the complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process, allows for low-cost, large-scale production and scaling of the device to higher densities and larger array sizes. We show the performance of the system by sequencing three bacterial genomes, its robustness and scalability by producing ion chips with up to 10 times as many sensors and sequencing a human genome.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues are routinely used for detecting mutational biomarkers in patients with cancer. A previous intractable challenge with FFPE DNA in genetic testing has been the high number of artifactual single-nucleotide changes (SNCs), particularly for the detection of low-level mutations. Pretreatment of FFPE DNA with uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) can markedly reduce these C:G{\textgreater}T:A SNCs with a small panel of amplicons. This procedure has implications for massively parallel sequencing approaches to mutation detection from DNA. We investigated whether sequence artifacts were problematic in amplicon-based massively parallel sequencing and what effect UDG pretreatment had on reducing these artifacts.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We amplified selected amplicons from lung cancer FFPE DNAs using the TruSeq Cancer Panel. SNCs occurring at a frequency {\textless}10{\%} were considered most likely to represent sequence artifacts and were enumerated for both UDG-treated and -untreated DNAs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Massively parallel sequencing of FFPE DNA samples showed multiple SNCs, predominantly C:G{\textgreater}T:A changes, with a significant proportion occurring above the background sequencing error (defined as 1{\%}). UDG pretreatment markedly reduced C:G{\textgreater}T:A SNCs without affecting the detection of true somatic mutations. However, C:G{\textgreater}T:A changes within CpG dinucleotides were often resistant to the UDG treatment as a consequence of 5-methyl cytosine being deaminated to thymine rather than uracil.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: UDG pretreatment greatly facilitates the accurate discrimination of mutations in FFPE samples by use of amplicon-based approaches. This is particularly important when working with samples with low tumor purity or for the assessment of mutational heterogeneity in tumors.},

An astonishing complexity of genome architecture has been revealed, bringing these sequencing technologies to even greater advancements. Some approaches maximize the number of bases sequenced in the least amount of time, generating a wealth of data that can be used to understand increasingly complex phenotypes. Alternatively, other approaches now aim to sequence longer contiguous pieces of DNA, which are essential for resolving structurally complex regions. These and other strategies are providing researchers and clinicians a variety of tools to probe genomes in greater depth, leading to an enhanced understanding of how genome sequence variants underlie phenotype and disease.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Precision medicine is dependent on identifying actionable mutations in tumors. Accurate detection of mutations is often problematic in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. DNA extracted from formalin-fixed tissues is fragmented and also contains DNA lesions that are the sources of sequence artifacts. Sequence artifacts can be difficult to distinguish from true mutations, especially in the context of tumor heterogeneity, and are an increasing interpretive problem in this era of massively parallel sequencing. Understanding of the sources of sequence artifacts in FFPE tissues and implementation of preventative strategies are critical to improve the accurate detection of actionable mutations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONTENT: This mini-review focuses on DNA template lesions in FFPE tissues as the source of sequence artifacts in molecular analysis. In particular, fragmentation, base modification (including uracil and thymine deriving from cytosine deamination), and abasic sites are discussed as indirect or direct sources of sequence artifacts. We discuss strategies that can be implemented to minimize sequence artifacts and to distinguish true mutations from sequence artifacts. These strategies are applicable for the detection of actionable mutations in both single amplicon and massively parallel amplicon sequencing approaches.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSUMMARY: Because FFPE tissues are usually the only available material for DNA analysis, it is important to maximize the accurate informational content from FFPE DNA. Careful consideration of each step in the work flow is needed to minimize sequence artifacts. In addition, validation of actionable mutations either by appropriate experimental design or by orthogonal methods should be considered.},

Although not directly cytotoxic, monoclonal anti-p185 antibody treatment causes neu-transformed NIH 3T3 cells to revert to a nontransformed phenotype, as determined by anchorage-independent growth. Isotype matched control antibodies of an unrelated specificity do not affect p185 levels or colony formation in soft agar by neu-transformed NIH 3T3 cells. Soft agar colony formation by NIH 3T3 cells transformed by ras oncogenes is not affected by anti-p185 antibody treatment. Anchorage-independent growth of cells from the ethyl nitrosourea-induced rat neuroblastoma line in which neu was originally detected by DNA transfection is also inhibited in the presence of anti-p185 monoclonal antibodies.

abstract = {Application of the massive parallel sequencing technology has become one of the most important issues in life sciences. Therefore, it was crucial to develop bioinformatics tools for next-generation sequencing (NGS) data processing. Currently, two of the most significant tasks include alignment to a reference genome and detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In many types of genomic analyses, great numbers of reads need to be mapped to the reference genome; therefore, selection of the aligner is an essential step in NGS pipelines. Two main algorithms-suffix tries and hash tables-have been introduced for this purpose. Suffix array-based aligners are memory-efficient and work faster than hash-based aligners, but they are less accurate. In contrast, hash table algorithms tend to be slower, but more sensitive. SNP and genotype callers may also be divided into two main different approaches: heuristic and probabilistic methods. A variety of software has been subsequently developed over the past several years. In this paper, we briefly review the current development of NGS data processing algorithms and present the available software.},

TS enhancer region, 3R G {\textgreater} C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), and TS 1494del6 polymorphisms were assessed in both fresh-frozen normal mucosa and tumor. Mutational analyses of TS and allelic imbalances were studied in all primary tumors and in 18 additional metachronic metastases.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred fourteen women with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive first-line treatment with trastuzumab 4 mg/kg loading dose, followed by 2 mg/kg weekly, or a higher 8 mg/kg loading dose, followed by 4 mg/kg weekly. RESULTS: The objective response rate was 26{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 18.2{\%} to 34.4{\%}), with seven complete and 23 partial responses. Response rates in 111 assessable patients with 3+ and 2+ HER2 overexpression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) were 35{\%} (95{\%} CI, 24.4{\%} to 44.7{\%}) and none (95{\%} CI, 0{\%} to 15.5{\%}), respectively. The clinical benefit rates in assessable patients with 3+ and 2+ HER2 overexpression were 48{\%} and 7{\%}, respectively. The response rates in 108 assessable patients with and without HER2 gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis were 34{\%} (95{\%} CI, 23.9{\%} to 45.7{\%}) and 7{\%} (95{\%} CI, 0.8{\%} to 22.8{\%}), respectively. Seventeen (57{\%}) of 30 patients with an objective response and 22 (51{\%}) of 43 patients with clinical benefit had not experienced disease progression at follow-up at 12 months or later. The most common treatment-related adverse events were chills (25{\%} of patients), asthenia (23{\%}), fever (22{\%}), pain (18{\%}), and nausea (14{\%}). Cardiac dysfunction occurred in two patients (2{\%}); both had histories of cardiac disease and did not require additional intervention after discontinuation of trastuzumab. There was no clear evidence of a dose-response relationship for response, survival, or adverse events.

By contrast, there are no existing systems for interpretation and clas -sification of somatic variants found from molecular testing of cancer. Methods: We designed an assessment protocol and classifica -tion system for somatic variants identified through next-generation sequencing molecular profiling of tumor-derived samples and applied these to a pilot dataset of somatic variants found by next-generation sequencing profiling of 158 tumor samples derived from advanced cancer patients examined at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre. Results: We present a classification system to interpret the signifi -cance of genetic variants in molecular analysis of cancer, including the following key factors: (i) known or predicted pathogenicity of the variant; (ii) primary site and tumor histology in which the variant is found; (iii) recurrence of the variant; and (iv) evidence of clinical actionability.

Next-generation sequencing assays allow the efficient and unbiased detection of clinically actionable mutations. To enable precision oncology in patients with solid tumors, we developed Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (MSK-IMPACT), a hybridization capture-based next-generation sequencing assay for targeted deep sequencing of all exons and selected introns of 341 key cancer genes in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumors. Barcoded libraries from patient-matched tumor and normal samples were captured, sequenced, and subjected to a custom analysis pipeline to identify somatic mutations. Sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility of MSK-IMPACT were assessed through extensive analytical validation. We tested 284 tumor samples with previously known point mutations and insertions/deletions in 47 exons of 19 cancer genes. All known variants were accurately detected, and there was high reproducibility of inter- and intrarun replicates. The detection limit for low-frequency variants was approximately 2{\%} for hotspot mutations and 5{\%} for nonhotspot mutations. Copy number alterations and structural rearrangements were also reliably detected. MSK-IMPACT profiles oncogenic DNA alterations in clinical solid tumor samples with high accuracy and sensitivity. Paired analysis of tumors and patient-matched normal samples enables unambiguous detection of somatic mutations to guide treatment decisions.},

abstract = {Several large ongoing initiatives that profit from next-generation sequencing technologies have driven - and in coming years will continue to drive - the emergence of long catalogs of missense single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the human genome. As a consequence, researchers have developed various methods and their related computational tools to classify these missense SNVs as probably deleterious or probably neutral polymorphisms. The outputs produced by each of these computational tools are of different natures and thus difficult to compare and integrate. Taking advantage of the possible complementarity between different tools might allow more accurate classifications. Here we propose an effective approach to integrating the output of some of these tools into a unified classification; this approach is based on a weighted average of the normalized scores of the individual methods (WAS). (In this paper, the approach is illustrated for the integration of five tools.) We show that this WAS outperforms each individual method in the task of classifying missense SNVs as deleterious or neutral. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this WAS can be used not only for classification purposes (deleterious versus neutral mutation) but also as an indicator of the impact of the mutation on the functionality of the mutant protein. In other words, it may be used as a deleteriousness score of missense SNVs.

abstract = {SN-38 is the active metabolite of irinotecan and it is metabolised through conjugation by uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase (UGT1A1). The major toxicity of irinotecan therapy is diarrhoea, which has been related to the enzymatic activity of UGT1A1. We examined the influence of the UGT1A1 gene promoter polymorphism in the toxicity profile, in the response rate and in the overall survival (OS) in 95 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with an irinotecan-containing chemotherapy. Genotypes were determined by analysing the sequence of TATA box of UGT1A1 of genomic DNA from the patients. Clinical parameters and genotypes were compared by univariate and multivariate statistical methods. The more frequent adverse effects were asthenia (34 patients), diarrhoea (29 patients) and neutropenia (20 patients). Severe diarrhoea was observed in 7/10 homozygous (70{\%}) and 15/45 heterozygous (33{\%}) in comparison to 7/40 (17{\%}) wild-type patients (P=0.005). These results maintained the statistical significance in logistic regression analysis (P=0.01) after adjustment for other clinical relevant variables. The presence of severe haematological toxicity increased from wild-type patients to UGT1A1(*)28 homozygotes, but without achieving statistical significance. No relationship was found between the UGT1A1(*)28 genotypes and infection, nausea or mucositis. In univariate studies, patients with the UGT1A1(*)28 polymorphism showed a trend to a poorer OS (P=0.09). In the multivariate analysis, the genotype was not related to clinical response or to OS. The role of the UGT1A1 genotype as a predictor of toxicity in cancer patients receiving irinotecan demands the performance of a randomized trial to ascertain whether genotype-adjusted dosages of the drug can help to establish safe and effective doses not only for patients with the UGT1A1(*)28 homozygous genotype but also for those with the most common UGT1A1 6/6 or 6/7 genotype.},

For clinical samples, methodologies must enable maximal extraction of available sequence information from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) material. We assessed the use of targeted capture for mutation detection in FFPE DNA. The capture probes targeted the coding region of all known kinase genes and selected oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes. Seven melanoma cell lines and matching FFPE xenograft DNAs were sequenced. An informatics pipeline was developed to identify variants and contaminating mouse reads. Concordance of 100{\%} was observed between unfixed and formalin-fixed for reported COSMIC variants including BRAF V600E. mutations in genes not conventionally screened including ERBB4, ATM, STK11 and CDKN2A were readily detected. All regions were adequately covered with independent reads regardless of GC content.

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS
The present study analyzed the relationship between TP53 codon 72 polymorphisms and the clinical outcome of advanced gastric cancer patients receiving capecitabine plus paclitaxel chemotherapy. 

METHODS
Three hundred patients with advanced gastric cancer treated with paclitaxel and capecitabine combination chemotherapy were enrolled in the present study. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes and determined using allele specific polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR). Correlation between TP53 codon 72 polymorphisms and treatment response, gastric cancer survival was analyzed. 

RESULTS
The Pro/Pro genotypes of TP53 codon 72 were significantly correlated with a lower response rate to capecitabine plus paclitaxel chemotherapy in patients with gastric cancer when compared to the Arg/Arg genotype (30.6 vs. 63.2{\%}, p value 0.000). Multivariate survival analysis also showed that the progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for patients with Pro/Pro genotypes of TP53 codon 72 were worse than for those with the Arg/Arg genotype (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.177, p = 0.009; HR = 2.145, p = 0.038, respectively). 

CONCLUSIONS
TP53 codon 72 polymorphisms was effective in predicting the response to chemotherapy and correlate with PFS and OS in patients with advanced gastric cancer treated with paclitaxel and capecitabine chemotherapy.},

abstract = {In clinical exome and genome sequencing, there is a potential for the recognition and reporting of incidental or secondary findings unrelated to the indication for ordering the sequencing but of medical value for patient care. The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) recently published a policy statement on clinical sequencing that emphasized the importance of alerting the patient to the possibility of such results in pretest patient discussions, clinical testing, and reporting of results. The ACMG appointed a Working Group on Incidental Findings in Clinical Exome and Genome Sequencing to make recommendations about responsible management of incidental findings when patients undergo exome or genome sequencing. This Working Group conducted a year-long consensus process, including an open forum at the 2012 Annual Meeting and review by outside experts, and produced recommendations that have been approved by the ACMG Board. Specific and detailed recommendations, and the background and rationale for these recommendations, are described herein. The ACMG recommends that laboratories performing clinical sequencing seek and report mutations of the specified classes or types in the genes listed here. This evaluation and reporting should be performed for all clinical germline (constitutional) exome and genome sequencing, including the "normal" of tumor-normal subtractive analyses in all subjects, irrespective of age but excluding fetal samples. We recognize that there are insufficient data on penetrance and clinical utility to fully support these recommendations, and we encourage the creation of an ongoing process for updating these recommendations at least annually as further data are collected.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The growing number of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) tests is transforming the routine clinical diagnosis of hereditary cancers. Identifying whether a cancer is the result of an underlying disease-causing mutation in a cancer predisposition gene is not only diagnostic for a cancer predisposition syndrome, but also has significant clinical implications in the clinical management of patients and their families. METHODS Here, we evaluated the performance of MSK-IMPACT (Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets) in detecting genetic alterations in 76 genes implicated in cancer predisposition syndromes. Output from hybridization-based capture was sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500. A custom analysis pipeline was used to detect single nucleotide variants (SNVs), small insertions/deletions (indels) and copy number variants (CNVs). RESULTS MSK-IMPACT detected all germline variants in a set of 233 unique patient DNA samples, previously confirmed by previous single gene testing. Reproducibility of variant calls was demonstrated using inter- and intra- run replicates. Moreover, in 16 samples, we identified additional pathogenic mutations other than those previously identified through a traditional gene-by-gene approach, including founder mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2 and APC, and truncating mutations in TP53, TSC2, ATM and VHL. CONCLUSIONS This study highlights the importance of the NGS-based gene panel testing approach in comprehensively identifying germline variants contributing to cancer predisposition and simultaneous detection of somatic and germline alterations.},

abstract = {Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) is the enzyme catalyzing the first step of pyrimidine metabolism. To date, genetic polymorphisms of pyrimidine-synthesizing enzymes have been reported to be associated with the risk of malignant lymphoma or colon cancer. Accordingly, there may be associations between dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPYD) polymorphism and the risk of malignancies. We conducted a prevalent case-control study to investigate the associations between a functional polymorphism of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, DPYD T85C, and the risk of six malignancies. Controls were 445 Nagoya City inhabitants without a history of malignancy who had participated in a health check-up between August and September 2000. Case subjects were 901 patients with malignancies (99 esophageal, 131 gastric, 143 colon, 179 lung, 243 breast, and 106 malignant lymphomas) who had visited Aichi Cancer Center Hospital between March 1999 and December 2000. No DPYD CC individuals were found in either cases or controls. The frequency of DPYD TC genotype was 6.3{\%} in control subjects and 5.9{\%} in all case subjects (not significant). In a subgroup analysis, the frequency of TC genotype was highest in patients with gastric cancer (9.1{\%}), followed by those with lung cancer (8.3{\%}), with the lowest frequency in those with malignant lymphoma (1.9{\%}). The gender- and age- adjusted odds ratios and 95{\%} confidence intervals for the TC genotype of gastric cancer and malignant lymphoma were 1.52 (0.71-3.28) and 0.31 (0.71-1.34), respectively. Although prevalent cases were used, this study suggested that the influence of DPYD T85C posed only a limited risk for the six malignancies.},

abstract = {Frozen biospecimens are crucial for translational research and contain well-preserved nucleic acids and protein. However, the risks of freezer failure as well as space, cost, and environmental concerns of frozen biospecimens are substantial. Objective: The purpose of the study was to review the current status of room temperature biospecimen storage. Methods: We searched Pubmed and vendor websites to identify relevant information. Results: Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues have great value but their use is limited by cross-linking and fragmentation of nucleic acids, as well as loss of enzymatic activity. Stabilization solutions can now robustly preserve fresh tissue for up to 7. days at room temperature. For longer term storage, commercial vendors of chemical matrices claim real time stability of nucleic acids of over 2 years and their accelerated aging studies to date suggest stability for 12. years for RNA and 60. years for DNA. However, anatomic pathology biorepositories store mostly frozen tissue rather than nucleic acids. Small quantities of tissue can be directly placed on some chemical matrices to stabilize DNA, however RNA and proteins are not preserved. Current lyophilization approaches can preserve histomorphology, DNA, RNA, and proteins though RNA shows moderate degradation after 1-2. years. Formalin-free fixatives show improved but varying abilities to preserve nucleic acids and face validation as well as cost barriers in replacing FFPE specimens. The paraffin embedding process can degrade RNA. Conclusion: Development of robust long-term room temperature biospecimen tissue storage technology can potentially reduce costs for the biomedical community in the face of growing targeted therapy needs and decreasing budgets. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.},

Fecal occult blood test (FOBT) is a non invasive, widespread screening method that can reduce CRC-related mortality. Sigmoidoscopy, alone or in addition to FOBT, represents another screening strategy that reduces CRC mortality. Colonoscopy is the best choice for screening high-risk populations, as it allows simultaneous detection and removal of preneoplastic lesions. The choice of test depends on local health policy and varies among countries.},

Over the past several years, the convergence of discovery, technology, and therapeutic development has created an unparalleled opportunity to test the hypothesis that systematic knowledge of genomic information from individual tumors can improve clinical outcomes for many patients with cancer. Rigorous evaluation of this genomics-driven cancer medicine hypothesis will require many logistic innovations that are guided by overarching conceptual advances in tumor genomic profiling, data interpretation, clinical trial design, and the ethical return of genetic results to oncologists and their patients. The results of these efforts and the rigor with which they are implemented will determine whether and how comprehensive tumor genomic information may become incorporated into the routine care of patients with cancer.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS Targeted exome sequencing of 202 genes was performed in 1000 advanced cancers using tumor and normal DNA in a research laboratory. Pathogenic variants in 18 genes, recommended for return by The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, as well as PALB2, were considered actionable. Patient preferences of return of incidental germline results were collected. Return of results was initiated with genetic counseling and repeat CLIA testing. RESULTS Of the 1000 patients who underwent sequencing, 43 had likely pathogenic germline variants: APC (1), BRCA1 (11), BRCA2 (10), TP53 (10), MSH2 (1), MSH6 (4), PALB2 (2), PTEN (2), TSC2 (1), and RB1 (1). 20 (47{\%}) of 43 variants were previously known based on clinical genetic testing. Of 1167 patients who consented for a germline testing protocol, 1157 (99{\%}) desired to be informed of incidental results. 23 previously unrecognized mutations identified in the research environment were confirmed with an orthogonal CLIA platform. All patients approached decided to proceed with formal genetic counseling; in all cases where formal genetic testing was performed the germline variant of concern validated with clinical genetic testing. CONCLUSIONS In this series 2.3{\%} patients had previously unrecognized pathogenic germline mutations in 19 cancer-related genes. Thus genomic sequencing must be accompanied by a plan for return of germline results, in partnership with genetic counseling.},

abstract = {We analysed whole-genome sequences of 560 breast cancers to advance understanding of the driver mutations conferring clonal advantage and the mutational processes generating somatic mutations. We found that 93 protein-coding cancer genes carried probable driver mutations. Some non-coding regions exhibited high mutation frequencies, but most have distinctive structural features probably causing elevated mutation rates and do not contain driver mutations. Mutational signature analysis was extended to genome rearrangements and revealed twelve base substitution and six rearrangement signatures. Three rearrangement signatures, characterized by tandem duplications or deletions, appear associated with defective homologous-recombination-based DNA repair: one with deficient BRCA1 function, another with deficient BRCA1 or BRCA2 function, the cause of the third is unknown. This analysis of all classes of somatic mutation across exons, introns and intergenic regions highlights the repertoire of cancer genes and mutational processes operating, and progresses towards a comprehensive account of the somatic genetic basis of breast cancer.},

@article{Schmidt2009,
abstract = {The concept of absorptive capacity was introduced by Cohen and Levinthal in 1989. Since then it has been enhanced through reconceptualizations and extended by various empirical studies. Despite the growing interest in absorptive capacity it is unclear what this large stream of papers has collectively accomplished. The used definitions, antecedents, components and outcomes of the construct are extremely heterogeneous. Due to this heterogeneity, the empirical study of the construct remains difficult. There is no standard measure and no standard method of measurement, which can be used in empirical research. To bring more clarity into this research area, this paper provides a critical review of previous empirical treatments of absorptive capacity. For this purpose, different methods of measurement are classified in the following way: within quantitative methods proxy indicators and perceptive instruments are differentiated. Proxy indicators use single firm-level data for measuring absorptive capacity and can be input-oriented (R{\&}D efforts, R{\&}D human capital) or output-oriented (R{\&}D patents, R{\&}D publications). Perceptive instruments imply that researchers develop single questions or a set of questions, which reflect absorptive capacity or parts of it at the operational level. The main weakness of both proxy indicators and perceptive instruments is that they don't meet the complexity and emergence of the construct. Only few qualitative studies have started to adopt a new perspective, recognizing the process and practice-based character of absorptive capacity. In summary, the critical review prints out the necessity of advancing research in this area. For this reason, we set out to develop an alternative approach to capture absorptive capacity. It is a practice-oriented approach that allows studying actual absorptive practices in real world situations and enables researchers to capture the complex, embedded, and context-dependent patterns of acting.},

abstract = {A TP53 gene polymorphism, resulting in an arginine (R) to proline (P) at codon 72 (TP53 R72P), has been associated with the susceptibility to various cancers. To better understand the role of this polymorphism in colorectal cancer etiology, we examined the association between TP53 R72P and colorectal cancer risk in 345 patients with colorectal cancer and 670 controls in a Chinese population. We observed that subjects with RP and PP genotypes had a 1.60-fold and a 2.37-fold increased risk for colorectal cancer, respectively. The 72P allele conferred a more pronounced increase in colorectal cancer risk among alcohol consumers (heterozygotes: OR = 3.01; homozygotes: OR = 4.71). The TP53 R72P polymorphism was not linked to tumor location, histologic grade, lymph node metastases, Dukes stage, p53 positivity, or age at diagnosis, but to tumor size. We conclude that the TP53 R72P polymorphism may contribute to the etiology of colorectal cancer in the Chinese population, particularly among alcohol consumers.},

abstract = {In this report, we describe combined polymorphisms of the UGT1A9, UGT1A7 and UGT1A1 genes in 100 unrelated, healthy Chinese Han subjects. The functional regions of these genes were sequenced and comprehensively analyzed for genetic polymorphisms. Thirty variants were detected, including five novel forms. Tentative functional predictions indicated that a Cys → Arg substitution at position 277 in the UGT1A7 gene could alter the protein conformation and that 12460T {\textgreater} G in the 3'UTR might influence protein translation through specifically expressed miRNAs. UGT1A9*1b was a major functional variant in the subjects examined whereas the *1f allele had a frequency of only 0.5{\%}. A special functional haplotype (GAGAAC) was identified for UGT1A9, 1A7 and 1A1. These findings provide fundamental genetic information that may serve as a basis for larger studies designed to assess the metabolic phenotypes associated with UGT1A polymorphisms. They also provide important data for the implementation of personalized medicine in Chinese Han.},

abstract = {A common arginine to proline polymorphism is harboured at codon 72 of the human p53 gene. In this investigation, we found that fibroblasts and lymphocytes isolated from arginine allele homozygote centenarians and sexagenarians (Arg+) undergo an oxidative-stress-induced apoptosis at a higher extent than cells obtained from proline allele carriers (Pro+). At variance, the difference in apoptosis susceptibility between Arg+ and Pro+ is not significant when cells from 30-year-old people are studied. Further, we found that Arg+ and Pro+ cells from centenarians differ in the constitutive levels of p53 protein and p53/MDM2 complex, as well as in the levels of oxidative stress-induced p53/Bcl-xL complex and mitochondria-localised p53. Consistently, all these differences are less evident in cells from 30-year-old people. Finally, we investigated the in vivo functional relevance of the p53 codon 72 genotype in a group of old patients (66-99 years of age) affected by acute myocardial ischaemia, a clinical condition in which in vivo cell death occurs. We found that Arg+ patients show increased levels of Troponin I and CK-MB, two serum markers that correlate with the extent of the ischaemic damage in comparison to Pro+ patients. In conclusion, these data suggest that p53 codon 72 polymorphism contributes to a genetically determined variability in apoptotic susceptibility among old people, which has a potentially relevant role in the context of an age-related pathologic condition, such as myocardial ischaemia.},

MTHFR 677C{\textgreater}T and 1298A{\textgreater}C polymorphisms are linked to altered enzyme activity. Thus, mutated MTHFR tumours should, in theory, be more sensitive to 5-fluorouracil (5FU) than wild-type tumours. MTHFR polymorphisms in position 677 and 1298 were analysed in 98 colorectal cancer patients with unresectable liver metastases (57 men, 41 women, mean age 64 years) receiving 5FU-folinic acid. 677C{\textgreater}T and 1298A{\textgreater}C genotypes were determined simultaneously by melting curve analyses on liver metastases. 677C{\textgreater}T genotype distribution was 46.9{\%} wt/wt, 34.7{\%} wt/mut and 18.4{\%} mut/mut; that of 1298A{\textgreater}C was 52.0{\%} wt/wt, 35.7{\%} wt/mut and 12.3{\%} mut/mut. The response rate was not related to 1298A{\textgreater}C genotype but was significantly linked to 677C{\textgreater}T genotype (response rate: 40{\%}, 21{\%} and 56{\%} in wt/wt, wt/mut and mut/mut, respectively; P = 0.040), with an increased response rate in mut/mut tumours relative to wt/wt (odds ratio = 1.88). Thymidylate synthase activity measured in metastases was a significant predictor of 5FU responsiveness and the addition of the 677C{\textgreater}T genotype improved model prediction. MTHFR 1298A{\textgreater}C polymorphism was significantly linked to specific survival, with homozygous mutated patients having the worst prognosis (P = 0.009, relative risk = 2.48 in mut/mut versus wt/wt). MTHFR 1298A{\textgreater}C genotype remained a significant predictor in a multivariate analysis including metastasis characteristics. The results suggest that MTHFR genotypes are relevant and independent factors of patient outcome in 5FU-based treatment of advanced colorectal cancer.},

The coding region of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase gene (DPYD) was sequenced in 45 cases with grade 3 or more capecitabine-related toxicity and in 100 randomly selected controls (cohort). Most discriminating (P {\textless} 0.1) or frequently occurring ({\textgreater}1{\%}) nonsynonymous SNPs were analyzed in all 568 patients. SNPs and haplotypes were associated with toxicity, capecitabine dose modifications, and survival.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A total of 29 SNPs were detected in the case-cohort analysis, of which 8 were analyzed in all 568 patients. Of the patients polymorphic for DPYD IVS14+1G{\textgreater}A, 2846A{\textgreater}T, and 1236G{\textgreater}A, 71{\%} (5 of 7), 63{\%} (5 of 8), and 50{\%} (14 of 28) developed grade 3 to 4 diarrhea, respectively, compared with 24{\%} in the overall population. All patients polymorphic for IVS14+1G{\textgreater}A developed any grade 3 to 4 toxicity, including one possibly capecitabine-related death. Because of toxicity, a mean capecitabine dose reduction of 50{\%} was applied in IVS14+1G{\textgreater}A and 25{\%} in 2846A{\textgreater}T variant allele carriers. Patients were categorized into six haplotype groups: one predicted for reduced (10{\%}), and two for increased risks (41{\%} and 33{\%}) for severe diarrhea.

abstract = {PURPOSE: Gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) result in unbalanced STAT signaling and cause immune dysregulation and immunodeficiency. The latter is often characterized by the susceptibility to recurrent Candida infections, resulting in the clinical picture of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC). This study aims to assess the frequency of GOF STAT1 mutations in a large international cohort of CMC patients.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: STAT1 was sequenced in genomic DNA from 57 CMC patients and 35 healthy family members. The functional relevance of nine different STAT1 variants was shown by flow cytometric analysis of STAT1 phosphorylation in patients' peripheral blood cells (PBMC) after stimulation with interferon (IFN)-$\alpha$, IFN-$\gamma$ or interleukin-27 respectively. Extended clinical data sets were collected and summarized for 26 patients.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Heterozygous mutations within STAT1 were identified in 35 of 57 CMC patients (61 {\%}). Out of 39 familial cases from 11 families, 26 patients (67 {\%}) from 9 families and out of 18 sporadic cases, 9 patients (50 {\%}) were shown to have heterozygous mutations within STAT1. Thirteen distinct STAT1 mutations are reported in this paper. Eight of these mutations are known to cause CMC (p.M202V, p.A267V, p.R274W, p.R274Q, p.T385M, p.K388E, p.N397D, and p.F404Y). However, five STAT1 variants (p.F172L, p.Y287D, p.P293S, p.T385K and p.S466R) have not been reported before in CMC patients.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: STAT1 mutations are frequently observed in patients suffering from CMC. Thus, sequence analysis of STAT1 in CMC patients is advised. Measurement of IFN- or IL-induced STAT1 phosphorylation in PBMC provides a fast and reliable diagnostic tool and should be carried out in addition to genetic testing.},

abstract = {Given the success of targeted agents in specific populations it is expected that some degree of molecular biomarker testing will become standard of care for many, if not all, cancers. To facilitate this, cancer centers worldwide are experimenting with targeted “panel” sequencing of selected mutations. Recent advances in genomic technology enable the generation of genome-scale data sets for individual patients. Recognizing the risk, inherent in panel sequencing, of failing to detect meaningful somatic alterations, we sought to establish processes to integrate data from whole-genome analysis (WGA) into routine cancer care. Between June 2012 and August 2014, 100 adult patients with incurable cancers consented to participate in the Personalized OncoGenomics (POG) study. Fresh tumor and blood samples were obtained and used for whole-genome and RNA sequencing. Computational approaches were used to identify candidate driver mutations, genes, and pathways. Diagnostic and drug information were then sought based on these candidate “drivers.” Reports were generated and discussed weekly in a multidisciplinary team setting. Other multidisciplinary working groups were assembled to establish guidelines on the interpretation, communication, and integration of individual genomic findings into patient care. Of 78 patients for whom WGA was possible, results were considered actionable in 55 cases. In 23 of these 55 cases, the patients received treatments motivated by WGA. Our experience indicates that a multidisciplinary team of clinicians and scientists can implement a paradigm in which WGA is integrated into the care of late stage cancer patients to inform systemic therapy decisions. },

abstract = {Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors effectively kill tumours defective in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes through the concept of synthetic lethality. It is suggested that PARP inhibitors cause an increase in DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs), which are converted during replication to irreparable toxic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in BRCA1/2 defective cells. There are a number of recent reports challenging this model. Here, alternative models that are not mutually exclusive are presented to explain the synthetic lethality between BRCA1/2 and PARP inhibitors. One such model proposes that PARP inhibition causes PARP-1 to be trapped onto DNA repair intermediates, especially during base excision repair. This may in turn cause obstruction to replication forks, which require BRCA-dependent homologous recombination to be resolved. In another model, PARP is directly involved in catalysing replication repair in a distinct pathway from homologous recombination. Experimental evidence supporting these novel models to explain the PARP-BRCA synthetic lethality are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2011 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the prognostic and predictive value of c-erbB-2 overexpression in breast cancer in relation to other prognostic markers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Paraffin-embedded tumors from 315 consecutive primary breast cancer patients were screened for c-erbB-2 protein (p185) overexpression by immunohistochemistry using the monoclonal antibody CB11. RESULTS: c-erbB-2 protein overexpression was detected in 19{\%} of tumors and was associated with shorter 5-year overall survival (OAS) rate compared with c-erbB-2-negative cases in the total patient material (58{\%} and 77{\%}, respectively; P = .004) and in the 96 node-positive patients (31{\%} and 61{\%}, respectively; P = .02), but not in node-negative patients. For 47 node-positive patients treated with adjuvant tamoxifen and radiotherapy, the 5-year OAS was 13{\%} for c-erbB-2 overexpression and 75{\%} for c-erbB-2-negative patients (P = .00004). The frequency of c-erbB-2 overexpression decreased with age at diagnosis. The prognostic value of c-erbB-2 on OAS was independent of age, node status, tumor size, histopathologic grade, hormone receptor status, S phase, p53 status, and adjuvant treatment. c-erbB-2 status added prognostic information to p53-negative and low S-phase cases, but not to p53-positive and high S-phase cases. Correspondingly, these only added information to c-erbB-2-negative cases. CONCLUSION: c-erbB-2 protein overexpression may have a predictive value with regard to adjuvant therapy in node-positive patients, for whom adjuvant tamoxifen with radiotherapy appears insufficient in the presence of c-erbB-2 overexpression. Combination of conventional and newer tumor markers may identify patients with a worse prognosis within groups with a generally favorable prognosis.},

abstract = {5-Fluorouracil is among the most widely used anticancer drug, but a fraction of treated patients develop severe toxicity, with potentially lethal injuries. The predictive power of the available pretreatment assays, used to identify patients at risk of severe toxicity, needs improvements. This study aimed to correlate a phenotypic marker of 5-fluorouracil metabolism (the individual degradation rate of 5-fluorouracil-5-FUDR) with 15 functional polymorphisms in the dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase gene (DPYD). Single SNP (single-nucleotide polymorphism) analysis revealed that the SNPs rs1801160, rs1801265, rs2297595 and rs3918290 (splice site variant IVS14+1G{\textgreater}A) were significantly associated with a decreased value of 5-FUDR, and the rs3918290 causing the larger decrease. Multi-SNP analysis showed that a three-SNP haplotype (Hap7) involving rs1801160, rs1801265 and rs2297595 causes a marked decrease in 5-FUDR, comparable to that caused by the splice site variant rs3918290, which is the main pharmacogenetic marker associated with severe fluorouracil toxicity. The similar effect played by Hap7 and by the splice site variant rs3918290 upon individual 5-FUDR suggests that Hap7 could also represent a similar determinant of fluorouracil toxicity. Haplotype assessment could improve the predictive value of DPYD genetic markers aimed at the pre-emptive identification of patients at risk of severe 5-fluorouracil toxicity.The Pharmacogenomics Journal advance online publication, 28 July 2015; doi:10.1038/tpj.2015.56.},

Irinotecan's active metabolite is inactivated by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1), which is deficient in Gilbert's syndrome. Irinotecan and metabolites are transported by P-glycoprotein, encoded by ABCB1. 5-FU targets folate metabolism through inhibition of thymidylate synthase (TYMS). Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) generates active folate necessary for haematopoiesis. We retrospectively genotyped 140 Swedish and Norwegian irinotecan and 5-FU-treated colorectal cancer patients from the Nordic VI clinical trial for selected variants of UGT1A1, ABCB1, TYMS and MTHFR. We found an increased risk of clinically relevant early toxicity in patients carrying the ABCB1 3435 T/T genotype, Odds ratio (OR)=3.79 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI)=1.09-13.2), and in patients carrying the UGT1A1(*)28/(*)28 genotype, OR=4.43 (95{\%} CI=1.30-15.2).

abstract = {Protein p53 is the tumor suppressor involved in cell cycle control and apoptosis. There are several polymorphisms reported for p53 which can affect important regions involved in protein tumor suppressor activity. Amongst the polymorphisms described, R213R and 13949 g→a are rarely studied, with an estimate frequency not yet available for the Brazilian population. The purpose of this study was to investigate the genotype and allele frequencies and associations of these polymorphisms in a group of patients with altered esophageal tissue from South Brazil and compare with the frequency observed for a control population. A total of 35 patients for R213R and 45 for 13494 g→a polymorphisms analysis with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms diagnosed by upper digestive endoscopy and confirmed by biopsy were studied. For both groups, 100 controls were used for comparison. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was also analyzed for a selected group of patients where normal and affected tissue was available. There was one patient with Barrett's Esophagus (BE) showing LOH for R213R out of two heterozygous samples analyzed and two patients (esophagitis and BE) for 13494 g→a polymorphism. We also aimed to build a haplotype for both polymorphisms collectively analyzed with R27P polymorphism, previously reported by our group. There were no significant differences in allele and genotype distribution between patients and controls. Although using esophagitis, intestinal metaplasia of the cardia and BE samples, all non-neoplastic lesions, we can conclude that these sites do not represent genetic susceptibility markers for the development and early progression of GERD to BE and esophageal cancer. Additional studies are required in order to investigate other determiners of early premalignant lesions known to predispose to esophageal cancer.},

abstract = {The tumor suppressor gene TP53 and its negative regulator murine double minute 2 are involved in multiple cellular pathways. Two potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) MDM2 SNP309 and TP53 R72P have been extensively investigated to be associated with breast cancer risk. However, the original studies as well as the subsequent meta-analysis, have yielded contradictory results for the individual effect of the two SNPs on breast cancer risk, plus that conflicting results also existed for the combined effects of MDM2 SNP309 and TP53 R72P on breast cancer risk. This meta-analysis aimed to clarify the individual and combined effects of these two genes on breast cancer risk. We performed a meta-analysis of publications with a total 9,563 cases and 9,468 controls concerning MDM2 SNP309 polymorphism and 19,748 cases and 19,962 controls concerning TP53 R72P. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95 {\%} confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of the association. In overall meta-analysis, individuals with the MDM2 SNP309TG genotype were associated with a borderline higher breast cancer risk than those with TT genotype (OR = 1.11, 95 {\%} CI: 1.00-1.24, P (heterogeneity) = 0.007), whereas the TP53 R72P CC or GC genotype had no effects on breast cancer risk. In the stratified analyses, a significant association between MDM2 SNP309 and breast cancer risk were observed in Asian, but null significant association between TP53 R72P and breast cancer risk were found even in various subgroups. Moreover, no significant combined effects of MDM2 SNP309 and TP53 R72P were observed on breast cancer risk. The borderline association between MDM2 SNP309 and breast cancer risk in overall analysis should be treated with caution, and no significant combined effects for the two SNPs on breast cancer risk suggested functional investigations warranted to explore the molecular mechanism of the TP53-MDM2 circuit genes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relationship between 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) pharmacokinetics and toxicity following i.v. bolus administration has not been extensively studied. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and eighty-one patients on adjuvant therapy with 5-FU plus leucovorin for colorectal cancer were the study population. 5-FU pharmacokinetics was determined on day 2 of the first, third, and fifth cycles; type and the grade of adverse reactions were recorded on the next cycle. RESULTS: The 5-FU area under the curve (AUC) measured at the first cycle ranged between 146 and 1236 mg x min/l and was significantly correlated with drug dose, patients' body weight (BW) and gender, females having higher AUCs. These covariates explained only 23{\%} of AUC variability. AUC and age were the only covariates which discriminated between toxic (grade {\textgreater} or =2) and nontoxic cycles (grade {\textless}2), with an optimal AUC cut-off value of 596 mg x min/l. Such a correlation was lost during the next cycles following dose reduction because of toxicity in 80 patients. CONCLUSIONS: A method for calculating the initial 5-FU dose is proposed which takes into account patient BW, gender and a target AUC of 596 mg x min/l. Nevertheless, it appears that a substantial part of 5-FU toxicity is not linked to pharmacokinetic factors and dose adjustments must still be on the basis of careful clinical surveillance.},

In this study, we assessed the effects of specific lesions on Taq DNA polymerase fidelity and amplification efficiency. In the presence of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2???-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG), Taq DNA polymerase inserted dCMP and to a lesser extent dAMP. 8-Oxo-7,8-dihydro-2???-deoxyadenosine (8-oxodA) instructed the incorporation of dTMP and caused a pronounced n - 1 deletion not observed in other systems. The presence of an abasic lesion led to dAMP incorporation and n - 1 deletions. In addition, we introduce the mean modified efficiency (MME) as a more precise method for determining PCR amplification efficiency of damaged templates. Using this method, we were able to quantify reductions in amplification efficiency of templates containing 8-oxodG (single or multiple), 8-oxodA, or abasic sites. Because the MME method can detect small reductions in amplification efficiency, it may be useful in comparing the extent of damage in environmentally degraded or archival DNA specimens. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is approximately 10-20x faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source SAMtools software package.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY: http://maq.sourceforge.net.},

abstract = {Massively parallel sequencing approaches are beginning to be used clinically to characterize individual patient tu- mors and to select therapies based on the identified mutations. A major question in these analyses is the extent to which these methods identify clinically actionable alterations and whether the examination of the tumor tissue alone is sufficient or whether matched normal DNA should also be analyzed to accurately identify tumor-specific (somatic) alterations. To address these issues, we comprehensively evaluated 815 tumor-normal paired samples from patients of 15 tumor types. We identified genomic alterations using next-generation sequencing of whole exomes or 111 targeted genes that were validated with sensitivities {\textgreater}95{\%} and {\textgreater}99{\%}, respectively, and specificities {\textgreater}99.99{\%}. These analyses revealed an average of 140 and 4.3 somatic mutations per exome and targeted analysis, respectively. More than 75{\%} of cases had somatic alterations in genes associated with known therapies or current clinical trials. Analyses of matched normal DNA identified germline alterations in cancer-predisposing genes in 3{\%} of patients with apparently sporadic cancers. In contrast, a tumor-only sequencing approach could not definitively identify germline changes in cancer-predisposing genes and led to additional false-positive find- ings comprising 31{\%} and 65{\%} of alterations identified in targeted and exome analyses, respectively, including in potentially actionable genes. These data suggest that matched tumor-normal sequencing analyses are essential for precise identification and interpretation of somatic and germline alterations and have important implications for the diagnostic and therapeutic management of cancer patients.},

Within a series of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative families, a germline TP53 13398 G{\textgreater}A (Arg213Gln) mutation was identified, which was selected for mutation analysis in this gene because of a family history consistent with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). Given the founder effects in this population, the 13398 G{\textgreater}A mutation was screened in series of 52 BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative cancer families, and a mutation-positive family was identified. However, pedigree inspection and expansion of mutation-positive families with the same mutation revealed that they were closely related to each other. To further characterize the contribution of TP53 in cancer families, mutation analysis was performed in the remaining BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative cancer families. Thirty sequence variants were identified, the majority of which occur in intronic sequences and are not predicted to affect the functionality of TP53. However, the 14538 G{\textgreater}A (Arg290His) mutation was identified in a family which did not exhibit features consistent with LFS or Li-Fraumeni-like (LFL) syndrome. Neither of the TP53 mutations was detected in 381 French Canadian women with breast cancer diagnosed before 50 years of age not selected for family history of cancer. In all, germline TP53 mutations were identified in two of 52 (3.8{\%}) cancer families, suggesting that TP53 is not a major contributor to BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative breast and/or ovarian cancer families of French Canadian descent.},

With these technologies, bases are inferred from light intensity signals, a process commonly referred to as base-calling. Thus, understanding and improving the quality of sequence data generated using these approaches are of high interest. Recently, a number of papers have characterized the biases associated with base-calling and proposed methodological improvements. In this review, we summarize recent development of base-calling approaches for the Illumina and Roche 454 sequencing platforms.},

abstract = {We sought to describe the spectrum of potential and confirmed germline genomic events incidentally identified during routine medium-throughput somatic tumor DNA sequencing, and to provide a framework for pre- and post-test consent and counseling for patients and families. Targeted tumor-only next-generation sequencing (NGS) had been used to evaluate for possible druggable genomic events obtained from consecutive new patients with metastatic gastroesophageal, hepatobiliary, or colorectal cancer seen at the University of Chicago. A panel of medical oncologists, cancer geneticists and genetic counselors retrospectively grouped these patients (N=111) based on probability of possessing a potentially inherited mutation in a cancer susceptibility gene, both prior to and after incorporating tumor-only NGS results. High-risk patients (determined from NGS results) were contacted and counseled in person by a genetic counselor (N=21). When possible and indicated, germline genetic testing was offered. Of 8 evaluable high-risk patients, 7 underwent germline testing. Three (37.5{\%}) had confirmed actionable germline mutations (all in the BRCA2 gene). NGS offers promise, but poses significant challenges for oncologists who are ill prepared to handle incidental findings that have clinical implications for at risk family members. In this relatively small cohort of patients undergoing tumor genomic testing for gastrointestinal malignancies, we incidentally identified 3 BRCA2 mutations carriers. This report underscores the need for oncologists to develop a framework for pre- and post-test communication of risks to patients undergoing routine tumor-only sequencing. {\textcopyright} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring activating mutations in the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) benefit from targeted therapies. A synonymous polymorphism (rs1050171, p.Q787Q) was shown to be associated with improved overall survival (OS) in colorectal cancer patients. As data in NSCLC are limited, we retrospectively ana- lyzed associations of p.Q787Q with clinicopathological parameters including clinical response and outcome in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) who received tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. Of 642 ADC patients whose tumors were profiled by next generation sequencing, 102 (15.9{\%}) carried EGFR mutations targetable by TKIs (30.4{\%} male patients, median age 65.1 y, 19.6{\%} smokers with 12.8 median pack years). Seventy-nine patients (77.5{\%}) received TKI therapy either as a first- or second-line therapy. Of the 102 EGFR-mutant tumors, 72 (70.6{\%}) exhibited the p.Q787Q polymorphism and another 12 (11.8{\%}) cases with p.Q787Q harbored an additional TKI insensitive mutation (p.T790M). The polymorphism was neither associated with classic clinicopathological parameters nor with overall survival (21.1 months vs. 20.1 months; P-value50.91) or clinical response (P-value50.122). The patients with p.T790M had worse survival compared to EGFR activating mutation carriers with and without p.Q787Q when analyzed as a separate group (27.5 months, P-value50.02). In conclusion, p.Q787Q is neither a suitable prognostic nor predictive biomarker for ADC patients receiving anti-EGFR therapy in first- or second-line of therapy.},

abstract = {Irinotecan unexpectedly causes severe toxicity of leukopenia or diarrhea. Irinotecan is metabolized to form active SN-38, which is further conjugated and detoxified by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 enzyme. Genetic polymorphisms of the UGT1A1 would affect an interindividual variation of the toxicity by irinotecan via the alternation of bioavailability of SN-38. In this case-control study, retrospective review of clinical records and determination of UGT1A1 polymorphisms were performed to investigate whether a patient with the variant UGT1A1 genotypes would be at higher risk for severe toxicity by irinotecan. All patients previously received irinotecan against cancer in university hospitals, cancer centers, or large urban hospitals in Japan. We identified 26 patients who experienced severe toxicity and 92 patients who did not. The relationship was studied between the multiple variant genotypes (UGT1A1*28 in the promoter and UGT1A1*6, UGT1A1*27, UGT1A1*29, and UGT1A1*7 in the coding region) and the severe toxicity of grade 4 leukopenia ({\textless} or =0.9 x 10(9)/liter) and/or grade 3 (watery for 5 days or more) or grade 4 (hemorrhagic or dehydration) diarrhea. Of the 26 patients with the severe toxicity, the genotypes of UGT1A1*28 were homozygous in 4 (15{\%}) and heterozygous in 8 (31{\%}), whereas 3 (3{\%}) homozygous and 10 (11{\%}) heterozygous were found among the 92 patients without the severe toxicity. Multivariate analysis suggested that the genotype either heterozygous or homozygous for UGT1A1*28 would be a significant risk factor for severe toxicity by irinotecan (P {\textless} 0.001; odds ratio, 7.23; 95{\%} confidence interval, 2.52-22.3). All 3 patients heterozygous for UGT1A1*27 encountered severe toxicity. No statistical association of UGT1A1*6 with the occurrence of severe toxicity was observed. None had UGT1A1*29 or UGT1A1*7. We suggest that determination of the UGT1A1 genotypes might be clinically useful for predicting severe toxicity by irinotecan in cancer patients. This research warrants a prospective trial to corroborate the usefulness of gene diagnosis of UGT1A1 polymorphisms prior tb irinotecan chemotherapy.},

abstract = {DNA sequence information underpins genetic research, enabling discoveries of important biological or medical benefit. Sequencing projects have traditionally used long (400-800 base pair) reads, but the existence of reference sequences for the human and many other genomes makes it possible to develop new, fast approaches to re-sequencing, whereby shorter reads are compared to a reference to identify intraspecies genetic variation. Here we report an approach that generates several billion bases of accurate nucleotide sequence per experiment at low cost. Single molecules of DNA are attached to a flat surface, amplified in situ and used as templates for synthetic sequencing with fluorescent reversible terminator deoxyribonucleotides. Images of the surface are analysed to generate high-quality sequence. We demonstrate application of this approach to human genome sequencing on flow-sorted X chromosomes and then scale the approach to determine the genome sequence of a male Yoruba from Ibadan, Nigeria. We build an accurate consensus sequence from {\textgreater}30x average depth of paired 35-base reads. We characterize four million single-nucleotide polymorphisms and four hundred thousand structural variants, many of which were previously unknown. Our approach is effective for accurate, rapid and economical whole-genome re-sequencing and many other biomedical applications.},

abstract = {More than ten million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified in humans; however, the importance of most SNPs for health and disease is not understood. Most SNPs are indeed unimportant and because of often inadequately powered studies, many observations on SNP effects can not be repeated by other researchers. SNPs are at best shown to influence protein function or level, rarely to influence risk of disease, and almost never to influence total mortality, the ultimate endpoint. A wellknown functional SNP in the tumor suppressor TP53 gene leads to increased longevity: in the Danish general population (n = 9219) homozygotes for the minor allele versus homozygotes for the major allele had an increase in median survival of 3 years. This is partly explained by increased survival after development of cancer or other diseases, in accordance with the observation that this Arg72Pro substitution in the p53 protein has important influence on cell death via increased apoptosis. Thus, the increased longevity may be due to a generally increased robustness after a diagnosis of any life-threatening disease. In contrast to widespread skepticism on the importance of SNPs in humans, this gain-of-function p53 SNP of importance for cell repair mechanisms has a profound influence on longevity.},

abstract = {Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has emerged as a powerful technique for the detection of genetic variants in the clinical laboratory. NGS can be performed using DNA from FFPE tissue, but it is unknown whether such specimens are truly equivalent to unfixed tissue for NGS applications. To address this question, we performed hybridization-capture enrichment and multiplexed Illumina NGS for 27 cancer-related genes using DNA from 16 paired fresh-frozen and routine FFPE lung adenocarcinoma specimens and conducted extensive comparisons between the sequence data from each sample type. This analysis revealed small but detectable differences between FFPE and frozen samples. Compared with frozen samples, NGS data from FFPE samples had smaller library insert sizes, greater coverage variability, and an increase in C to T transitions that was most pronounced at CpG dinucleotides, suggesting interplay between DNA methylation and formalin-induced changes; however, the error rate, library complexity, enrichment performance, and coverage statistics were not significantly different. Comparison of base calls between paired samples demonstrated concordances of {\textgreater}99.99{\%}, with 96.8{\%} agreement in the single-nucleotide variants detected and {\textgreater}98{\%} accuracy of NGS data when compared with genotypes from an orthogonal single-nucleotide polymorphism array platform. This study demonstrates that routine processing of FFPE samples has a detectable but negligible effect on NGS data and that these samples can be a reliable substrate for clinical NGS testing. ?? 2013 American Society for Investigative Pathology and the Association for Molecular Pathology.

abstract = {The potential clinical utility of genetic markers associated with response to fluoropyrimidine treatment in colorectal cancer patients remains controversial despite extensive study. Our aim was to test the clinical validity of both novel and previously identified markers of adverse events in a broad clinical setting. We have conducted an observational pharmacogenetic study of early adverse events in a cohort study of 254 colorectal cancer patients treated with 5-fluorouracil or capecitabine. Sixteen variants of nine key folate (pharmacodynamic) and drug metabolising (pharmacokinetic) enzymes have been analysed as individual markers and/or signatures of markers. We found a significant association between TYMP S471L (rs11479) and early dose modifications and/or severe adverse events (adjusted OR = 2.02 [1.03; 4.00], p = 0.042, adjusted OR = 2.70 [1.23; 5.92], p = 0.01 respectively). There was also a significant association between these phenotypes and a signature of DPYD mutations (Adjusted OR = 3.96 [1.17; 13.33], p = 0.03, adjusted OR = 6.76 [1.99; 22.96], p = 0.002 respectively). We did not identify any significant associations between the individual candidate pharmacodynamic markers and toxicity. If a predictive test for early adverse events analysed the TYMP and DPYD variants as a signature, the sensitivity would be 45.5 {\%}, with a positive predictive value of just 33.9 {\%} and thus poor clinical validity. Most studies to date have been under-powered to consider multiple pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variants simultaneously but this and similar individualised data sets could be pooled in meta-analyses to resolve uncertainties about the potential clinical utility of these markers.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of S-1 in combination with oxaliplatin in a biweekly schedule as first-line treatment in metastatic colorectal cancer and the association between genetic polymorphisms and treatment outcomes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Eligibility included age 18-75 years, at least one measurable lesion, no prior chemotherapy except adjuvant chemotherapy, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (PS) 0-2. S-1 40 mg/m(2) b.i.d. on days 1-7 with 85 mg/m(2) of oxaliplatin on day 1 was repeated every 2 weeks. Genomic DNA from whole blood was analyzed for 15 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among 8 genes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Fifty-two patients (median age 63 years, range 37-74) were enrolled: 37 men and 15 women; 44 with a PS of 0 and 8 with a PS of 1; and 41 with initially metastatic cancer and 11 with relapsed disease. Among 51 evaluable patients, objective response rate was 47.1{\%} [95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 32.9-61.2]. Median follow-up duration was 17.1 months (range 3.9-28.2 months). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 6.4 months (95{\%} CI 4.8-8.1), and median overall survival had not been reached yet. Reported grade 3 toxicities were neutropenia (7.7{\%}), thrombocytopenia (5.8{\%}), sensory neuropathy (7.7{\%}) and diarrhea (1.9{\%}). There was no grade 4 toxicity or neutropenic fever. Patients with A/G or G/G genotype in GSTP1 Ile105Val SNP had longer PFS than patients with A/A (median 8.3 vs. 6.1 months, P = 0.04).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Biweekly S-1 with oxaliplatin is effective and has improved tolerability and convenience compared to other fluoropyrimidine with oxaliplatin combinations. GSTP1 Ile105Val SNP is associated with treatment outcomes.},

Herein, we describe a new computational method, called RePlow that we developed to detect low-VAF somatic mutations based on simple, library-level replicates for next-generation sequencing on any platform.

Determination of the functional consequences of sequence variant alleles offers potential insight as to how genotype may influence phenotype. Even within protein coding regions of the genome, establishing the consequences of variation on gene and protein function is challenging and requires substantial laboratory investigation. However, a series of bioinformatics tools have been developed to predict whether non-synonymous variants are neutral or disease-causing. In this study we evaluate the performance of nine such methods (SIFT, PolyPhen2, SNPs{\&}GO, PhD-SNP, PANTHER, Mutation Assessor, MutPred, Condel and CAROL) and developed CoVEC (Consensus Variant Effect Classification), a tool that integrates the prediction results from four of these methods.

abstract = {Utilizing the concept of synthetic lethality has provided new opportunities for the development of targeted therapies, by allowing the targeting of loss of function genetic aberrations. In cancer cells with BRCA1 or BRCA2 loss of function, which harbor deficiency of DNA repair by homologous recombination, inhibition of PARP1 enzymatic activity leads to an accumulation of single strand breaks that are converted to double strand breaks but cannot be repaired by homologous recombination. Inhibition of PARP has therefore been advanced as a novel targeted therapy for cancers harboring BRCA1/2 mutations. Preclinical and preliminary clinical evidence, however, suggests a potentially broader scope for PARP inhibitors. Loss of function of various proteins involved in double strand break repair other than BRCA1/2 has been suggested to be synthetically lethal with PARP inhibition. Inactivation of these genes has been reported in a subset of human cancers and might therefore constitute predictive biomarkers for PARP inhibition. Here we discuss the evidence that the clinical use of PARP inhibition may be broader than targeting of cancers in BRCA1/2 germ-line mutation carriers.},

abstract = {248 | VOL.7 NO.4 | APRIL 2010 | nature methods correspondence tions (omitting the time stamps). We used interventional data on steady-state gene expression levels of known single-gene knock-out experiments as the gold standard for determining the causal effects. We applied IDA, as well as Lasso and Elastic-net, to the observational datasets and evaluated how well the resulting top q predicted effects (q = 10 for the networks of size 10 and q = 25 for the networks of size 100) corresponded to the top m percentage (m = 5 or 10) of the effects as computed from the interventional data (Supplementary Methods). We counted the number of networks in which the partial area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (pAUC) was better than random guessing at significance level a = 0.01 for both values of m (Supplementary Methods). By this measure, IDA was at least as good as Lasso and Elastic-net for all four possible combinations of the type of observational data (multifactorial or time series) and the size of the networks (10 or 100 genes). The difference was largest for the multifactorial data on the networks of size 10, where IDA was substantially better than Lasso and Elastic-net for three of the five networks (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 2). For instance, in this setting with m = 10 and q = 10, IDA found 4, 4, 5, 1 and 2 true positives for the five different networks, whereas Lasso found 1, 1, 0, 1 and 2 true positives and Elastic-net found 3, 1, 0, 1 and 1 true positives. The results presented here on S. cerevisiae and the DREAM4 data are proof-of-concept results that IDA can predict the stron-gest causal effects in potentially large-scale biological systems by using only observational data. In particular, the results on S. cerevisiae demonstrate that we were able to do this in a chal-lenging real-world setting where the number of variables (5,361) was much larger than the sample size (63) and the variables were substantially disturbed by noise. As IDA is supported by math-ematical theory, we expect the results presented here to generalize to other problems. Of course, statistical predictions based on observational data can never replace intervention experiments. In fact, whenever possible, IDA predictions should be followed up by intervention experiments. In this way, the predictions can serve as a new tool for the design of experiments, as they indicate which interven-tions are likely to show a large effect. Software for IDA is available in the open source R-package pcalg (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pcalg/index. html). To the Editor: Applications of rapidly advancing sequencing technology exacerbate the need to interpret individual sequence variants. Sequencing of phenotyped clinical subjects will soon become a method of choice in studies of the genetic causes of Mendelian and complex diseases. New exon-capture techniques will direct sequencing efforts to the most informative and easily interpretable protein-coding fraction of the genome. Thus, the demand for computational predictions of the impact of protein sequence variants will continue to grow. Here we present a new method and the corresponding soft-ware tool, PolyPhen-2 (http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/, Supplementary Software), for predicting damaging effects of missense mutations. PolyPhen-2 is different from the earlier tool PolyPhen 1 in the set of predictive features, the alignment pipeline and the method of classification (Fig. 1a). PolyPhen-2 uses eight sequence-based and three structure-based predictive features (Supplementary Table 1), which were selected automati-cally by an iterative greedy algorithm (Supplementary Methods). The majority of these features involve comparison of a property of the wild-type (ancestral, normal) allele and the correspond-ing property of the mutant (derived, disease-causing) allele. The alignment pipeline selects a set of homologous sequences using a clustering algorithm and then constructs and refines its multiple alignment (Supplementary Fig. 1). The most informa-tive predictive features characterize how likely the two human alleles are to occupy the site given the pattern of amino-acid replacements in the multiple-sequence alignment; how distant the protein harboring the first deviation from the human wild-type allele is from the human protein; and whether the mutant allele originated at a hypermutable site 2 . The functional impor-tance of an allele replacement is predicted from its individual features (Supplementary Figs. 2–4) by a naive Bayes classifier (Supplementary Methods). We used two pairs of datasets to train and test PolyPhen-2. We compiled the first pair, HumDiv, from all 3,155 damaging alleles annotated in the UniProt database as causing human Mendelian diseases and affecting protein stability or function, together with 6,321 differences between human proteins and their closely related mammalian homologs, assumed to be nondamaging (Supplementary Methods). The second pair, HumVar 3 , consists of all the 13,032 human disease-causing mutations from UniProt and 8,946 human nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymor-phisms (nsSNPs) without annotated involvement in disease, which we treated as nondamaging. We found that PolyPhen-2 performance, as presented by its receiver operating characteristic curves, was consistently superior compared to that of PolyPhen (Fig. 1b) and it also compared favorably with that of three other popular prediction tools 4–6 (Fig. 1c). For a false positive rate of 20{\%}, PolyPhen-2 achieved true positive prediction rates of 92{\%} and 73{\%} on HumDiv and HumVar datasets, respectively (Supplementary Table 2). One reason for the lower accuracy of predictions on HumVar is that nsSNPs assumed to be nondamaging in the HumVar dataset included a sizable fraction of mildly deleterious alleles. In con-trast, most amino-acid replacements assumed nondamaging in},

abstract = {PURPOSE: UGT1A1*28 polymorphism has been associated with decreased glucuronidation of SN38, the active metabolite of irinotecan. This could increase toxicity with this agent. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a prospective study, 250 metastatic colorectal cancer patients were treated with irinotecan, fluorouracil, and leucovorin as first-line treatment. UGT1A1*28 polymorphism was investigated with respect to the distribution of hematologic and nonhematologic toxicity, objective response rate, and survival. Pharmacokinetics was investigated in a subgroup of patients (71 of 250) who had been analyzed with respect to toxicity and efficacy. RESULTS: UGT1A1*28 polymorphism was associated with a higher risk of grade 3 to 4 hematologic toxicity (odds ratio [OR], 8.63; 95{\%} CI, 1.31 to 56.55), which was only relevant for the first cycle, and was not seen throughout the whole treatment period for patients with both variant alleles TA7/TA7 compared with wild-type TA6/TA6. The response rate was also higher in TA7/TA7 patients (OR, 0.32; 95{\%} CI, 0.12 to 0.86) compared with TA6/TA6. A nonsignificant survival advantage was observed for TA7/TA7 when compared with TA6/TA6 patients (hazard ratio, 0.81; 95{\%} CI, 0.45 to 1.44). Higher response rates were explained by a different pharmacokinetics with higher biliary index [irinotecan area under the curve (AUC)x(SN38 AUC/SN38G AUC)] and lower glucuronidation ratio (SN38G AUC/SN38 AUC) associated with the TA7/TA7 genotype and a higher response rate, indicating that the polymorphism is functionally relevant. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that UGT1A1*28 polymorphism is of some relevance to toxicity; however, it is less important than discussed in previous smaller trials. In particular, the possibility of a dose reduction for irinotecan in patients with a UGT1A1*28 polymorphism is not supported by the result of this analysis.},

The crystal structure of the homodimeric pig liver enzyme (2x 111 kDa) determined at 1.9 A resolution reveals a highly modular subunit organization, consisting of five domains with different folds. Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase contains two FAD, two FMN and eight [4Fe-4S] clusters, arranged in two electron transfer chains that pass the dimer interface twice. Two of the Fe-S clusters show a hitherto unobserved coordination involving a glutamine residue. The ternary complex of an inactive mutant of the enzyme with bound NADPH and 5-fluorouracil reveals the architecture of the substrate-binding sites and residues responsible for recognition and binding of the drug.},

UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) catalyzes the glucuronidation of the active metabolite SN-38. This study prospectively evaluated the association between the prevalence of severe toxicity and UGT1A1 genetic variation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-six cancer patients with advanced disease refractory to other treatments received irinotecan 350 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks. Toxicity and pharmacokinetic data were measured during cycle 1. UGT1A1 variants (-3279G{\textgreater}T, -3156G{\textgreater}A, promoter TA indel, 211G{\textgreater}A, 686C{\textgreater}A) were genotyped. RESULTS: The prevalence of grade 4 neutropenia was 9.5{\%}. Grade 4 neutropenia was much more common in patients with the TA indel 7/7 genotype (3 of 6 patients; 50{\%}) compared with 6/7 (3 of 24 patients; 12.5{\%}) and 6/6 (0 of 29 patients; 0{\%}) (P =.001). The TA indel genotype was significantly associated with the absolute neutrophil count nadir (7/7 {\textless} 6/7 {\textless} 6/6, P =.02). The relative risk of grade 4 neutropenia was 9.3 (95{\%} CI, 2.4 to 36.4) for the 7/7 patients versus the rest of the patients. Pretreatment total bilirubin levels (mean +/- standard deviation) were significantly higher in patients with grade 4 neutropenia (0.83 +/- 0.08 mg/dL) compared to those without grade 4 neutropenia (0.47 +/- 0.03 mg/dL; P {\textless}.001). The -3156G{\textgreater}A variant seemed to distinguish different phenotypes of total bilirubin within the TA indel genotypes. The -3156 genotype and the SN-38 area under the concentration versus time curve were significant predictors of ln(absolute neutrophil count nadir; r(2) = 0.51). CONCLUSION: UGT1A1 genotype and total bilirubin levels are strongly associated with severe neutropenia, and could be used to identify cancer patients predisposed to the severe toxicity of irinotecan. The hypothesis that the -3156G{\textgreater}A variant is a better predictor of UGT1A1 status than the previously reported TA indel requires further testing.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Phase II trials suggested that weekly paclitaxel might be more effective and less toxic than every-3-weeks administration for metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) protocol 9840 was initiated to address this question. Subsequently trastuzumab was demonstrated to improve outcomes of paclitaxel therapy for human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2)-positive patients, and was therefore incorporated. Because inhibition of HER-family signaling had potential efficacy even without HER-2 overexpression, we randomly assigned for trastuzumab in this population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks or 80 mg/m(2) weekly. After the first 171 patients, all HER-2-positive patients received trastuzumab; HER-2 nonoverexpressors were randomly assigned for trastuzumab, in addition to paclitaxel schedule. A total of 577 patients were treated on 9840. An additional 158 patients were included in analyses, for combined sample of 735. The primary end point was response rate (RR); secondary end points were time to progression (TTP), overall survival, and toxicity. Primary comparisons were between weekly versus every-3-weeks paclitaxel, and trastuzumab versus no trastuzumab in HER-2 nonoverexpressors. RESULTS: In the combined sample, weekly paclitaxel was superior to every-3-weeks administration: RR (42{\%} v 29{\%}, unadjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.75; P = .0004), TTP (median, 9 v 5 months; adjusted HR = 1.43; P {\textless} .0001), and survival (median, 24 v 12 months; adjusted HR = 1.28; P = .0092). For HER-2 nonoverexpressors, trastuzumab did not improve efficacy. Grade 3 neuropathy was more common with weekly dosing (24{\%} v 12{\%}; P = .0003). CONCLUSION: Weekly paclitaxel is more effective than every-3-weeks administration for MBC. Trastuzumab did not improve efficacy for HER-2 nonoverexpressors. Neurotoxicity is a treatment-limiting toxicity for weekly paclitaxel.},

In this work, we retrospectively evaluated the influence of a polymorphism in the TYMP gene (rs112723255; G/A) upon the outcome of 448 patients subjected to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) from an human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling donor. The TYMP genotype of patients correlated with overall survival-carriers of the minor allele (A) being at an increased risk of dying after transplantation (hazard ratio, HR = 1.9; P = 0.004). This effect was mostly due to differences in transplant toxicity-related mortality (HR = 2.5; P = 0.029). In addition, the TYMP genotype of donors was associated with the risk of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-carriers of the minor allele being at an increased risk of developing this complication ([HR] = 1.7; P = 0.039). The impact of such polymorphism on the risk of chronic GVHD is limited to patients transplanted in early stage disease (HR = 2.2; P = 0.019). The combination of a donor harboring the minor allele with a patient homozygous for the major allele was associated with the highest risk of chronic GVHD (HR = 2.8; P = 0.008). These findings provide the first evidence of the significant impact of the TYMP genotype upon the clinical outcome of patients treated with HLA-identical sibling allo-SCT. Am. J.

abstract = {We show that DNA molecules amplified by PCR from DNA extracted from animal bones and teeth that vary in age between 25 000 and over 50 000 years carry C--{\textgreater}T and G--{\textgreater}A substitutions. These substitutions can reach high proportions among the molecules amplified and are due to the occurrence of modified deoxycytidine residues in the template DNA. If the template DNA is treated with uracil N-glycosylase, these substitutions are dramatically reduced. They are thus likely to result from deamination of deoxycytidine residues. In addition, 'jumping PCR', i.e. the occurrence of template switching during PCR, may contribute to these substitutions. When DNA sequences are amplified from ancient DNA extracts where few template molecules initiate the PCR, precautions such as DNA sequence determination of multiple clones derived from more than one independent amplification are necessary in order to reduce the risk of determination of incorrect DNA sequences. When such precautionary measures are taken, errors induced by damage to the DNA template are unlikely to be more frequent than approximately 0.1{\%} even under the unlikely scenario where each amplification starts from a single template molecule.},

Exome sequencing, where the coding region of the genome is captured and sequenced at a deep level, has proven to be a cost-effective method to detect disease-causing vaiants and discover gene targets. In this review, we outline the general framework of whole exome processing, alignment, post-processing, and variant analysis (detection, annotation, and prioritization). We evaluate the performance of open-source alignment programs and variant calling tools using simulated and benchmark datasets, and highlight the challenges posed by the lack of concordance among variant detection tools. Based on these results, we recommend adopting multiple tools and resources to reduce false positives and increase the sensitivity of variant calling. In addition, we briefly discuss the current status and solutions for big data management, analysis and summarization in the field of bioinformatics.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included a retrospective analysis of 88 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and a prospective trial with 51 patients also with measurable metastases. All patients were treated with FU and leucovorin. The analysis of gene polymorphism was performed on normal intestinal tissue and lymphocytes. RESULTS: The response rate was significantly higher in patients with TS 3R/3R or MTHFR 677 TT gene polymorphism compared with the other groups. The difference of response rate translated to a difference in time to progression. Similar results were observed in the retrospective analysis and the prospective confirmatory trial. CONCLUSION: The analysis of gene polymorphism allows delineation of a group of patients (30{\%}) with a response rate to a single drug of approximately 50{\%}. This information should be used in the design of tailored treatment.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal carcinomas are genomically complex cancers that are  lethal in the metastatic setting. Whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing allow for the simultaneous characterization of multiple oncogenic pathways. METHODS: We report 3 cases of metastatic gastrointestinal carcinoma in patients enrolled in the Personalized Onco-Genomics program at the BC Cancer Agency. Real-time genomic profiling was combined with clinical expertise to diagnose a carcinoma of unknown primary, to explore treatment response to bevacizumab in a colorectal cancer, and to characterize an appendiceal adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: In the first case, genomic profiling revealed an IDH1 somatic mutation, supporting the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma in a malignancy of unknown origin, and further guided therapy by identifying epidermal growth factor receptor amplification. In the second case, a BRAF V600E mutation and wild-type KRAS profile justified the use of targeted therapies to treat a colonic adenocarcinoma. The third case was an appendiceal adenocarcinoma defined by a p53 inactivation; Ras/raf/mek, Akt/mtor, Wnt, and notch pathway activation; and overexpression of ret, erbb2 (her2), erbb3, met, and cell cycle regulators. SUMMARY: We show that whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing can be achieved within clinically effective timelines, yielding clinically useful and actionable information.},

Here, we describe the discovery of novel C {\textgreater} A/G {\textgreater} T transversion artifacts found at low allelic fractions in targeted capture data. Characteristics such as sequencer read orientation and presence in both tumor and normal samples strongly indicated a non-biological mechanism. We identified the source as oxidation of DNA during acoustic shearing in samples containing reactive contaminants from the extraction process. We show generation of 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) lesions during DNA shearing, present analysis tools to detect oxidation in sequencing data and suggest methods to reduce DNA oxidation through the introduction of antioxidants. Further, informatics methods are presented to confidently filter these artifacts from sequencing data sets. Though only seen in a low percentage of reads in affected samples, such artifacts could have profoundly deleterious effects on the ability to confidently call rare mutations, and eliminating other possible sources of artifacts should become a priority for the research community.},

abstract = {This study aims at establishing relationships between genetic and non-genetic factors of variation of the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan and its metabolites; and also at establishing relationships between the pharmacokinetic or metabolic parameters and the efficacy and toxicity of irinotecan. We included 49 patients treated for metastatic colorectal cancer with a combination of 5-fluorouracil and irinotecan; a polymorphism in the UGT1A1 gene (TA repeat in the TATA box) and one in the CES2 gene promoter (830C{\textgreater}G) were studied as potential markers for SN-38 glucuronidation and irinotecan activation, respectively; and the potential activity of CYP3A4 was estimated from cortisol biotransformation into 6beta-hydroxycortisol. No pharmacokinetic parameter was directly predictive of clinical outcome or toxicity. The AUCs of three important metabolites of irinotecan, SN-38, SN-38 glucuronide and APC, were tentatively correlated with patients' pretreatment biological parameters related to drug metabolism (plasma creatinine, bilirubin and liver enzymes, and blood leukocytes). SN-38 AUC was significantly correlated with blood leukocytes number and SN-38G AUC was significantly correlated with plasma creatinine, whereas APC AUC was significantly correlated with plasma liver enzymes. The relative extent of irinotecan activation was inversely correlated with SN-38 glucuronidation. The TATA box polymorphism of UGT1A1 was significantly associated with plasma bilirubin levels and behaved as a significant predictor for neutropoenia. The level of cortisol 6beta-hydroxylation predicted for the occurrence of diarrhoea. All these observations may improve the routine use of irinotecan in colorectal cancer patients. UGT1A1 genotyping plus cortisol 6beta-hydroxylation determination could help to determine the optimal dose of irinotecan.},

At present, the only accepted molecular marker predictive of the response to anti-EGFR mAbs is the somatic mutation of KRAS and NRAS as a marker of resistance to anti-EGFR. However, only a fraction of KRAS wild-type patients benefit from that treatment. In this study, we show that the EGFR gene polymorphism rs1050171 defines, independently of RAS mutational status, a sub-population of 11 {\%} of patients with a better clinical outcome after anti-EGFR treatment. Median PFS for patients with the GG genotype was 10.17 months compared to 5.37 of those with AG + AA genotypes. Taken together, our findings could be used to better define CRC populations responding to anti-EGFR therapy. Further studies in larger independent cohorts are necessary to validate the present observation that a synonymous polymorphism in EGFR gene impacts on clinical responsiveness.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Delayed-type diarrhea is a common side effect of irinotecan and is associated with a bacterial-mediated formation of the active irinotecan metabolite SN-38 from its glucuronide conjugate in the intestine. Based on a pilot study, we hypothesized that concomitant administration of the antibiotic neomycin would diminish exposure of the gut to SN-38 and ameliorate the incidence and severity of diarrhea. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were treated with irinotecan in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Eligible patients received irinotecan (350 mg/m(2) once every 3 weeks) combined with neomycin (660 mg three times daily for three consecutive days, starting 2 days before chemotherapy) or combined with placebo. Blood samples were obtained for additional pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenetic analyses. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were evaluable for the toxicity analysis. Baseline patient characteristics, systemic SN-38 exposure, and UGT1A1*28 genotype status (i.e., an additional TA repeat in the promoter region of uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase isoform 1A1) were similar in both arms. Although distribution, severity, and duration of delayed-type diarrhea did not differ significantly between arms, grade 3 diarrhea tended to be less frequent in the neomycin arm. The presence of at least one UGT1A1*28 allele was strongly related to the incidence of grade 2-3 diarrhea. In the neomycin arm, grade 2 nausea was significantly more common. CONCLUSION: Our results do not suggest a major role for neomycin as prophylaxis for irinotecan-induced delayed-type diarrhea. It is suggested that the UGT1A1*28 genotype status could be used as a screening tool for a priori prevention of irinotecan-induced delayed-type diarrhea.},

abstract = {Isolating high-priority segments of genomes greatly enhances the efficiency of next-generation sequencing (NGS) by allowing researchers to focus on their regions of interest. For the 2010-11 DNA Sequencing Research Group (DSRG) study, we compared outcomes from two leading companies, Agilent Technologies (Santa Clara, CA, USA) and Roche NimbleGen (Madison, WI, USA), which offer custom-targeted genomic enrichment methods. Both companies were provided with the same genomic sample and challenged to capture identical genomic locations for DNA NGS. The target region totaled 3.5 Mb and included 31 individual genes and a 2-Mb contiguous interval. Each company was asked to design its best assay, perform the capture in replicates, and return the captured material to the DSRG-participating laboratories. Sequencing was performed in two different laboratories on Genome Analyzer IIx systems (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Sequencing data were analyzed for sensitivity, specificity, and coverage of the desired regions. The success of the enrichment was highly dependent on the design of the capture probes. Overall, coverage variability was higher for the Agilent samples. As variant discovery is the ultimate goal for a typical targeted sequencing project, we compared samples for their ability to sequence single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as a test of the ability to capture both chromosomes from the sample. In the targeted regions, we detected 2546 SNPs with the NimbleGen samples and 2071 with Agilent's. When limited to the regions that both companies included as baits, the number of SNPs was ∼1000 for each, with Agilent and NimbleGen finding a small number of unique SNPs not found by the other.},

abstract = {Copy number variation (CNV) in the genome is a complex phenomenon, and not completely understood. We have developed a method, CNVnator, for CNV discovery and genotyping from read-depth (RD) analysis of personal genome sequencing. Our method is based on combining the established mean-shift approach with additional refinements (multiple-bandwidth partitioning and GC correction) to broaden the range of discovered CNVs. We calibrated CNVnator using the extensive validation performed by the 1000 Genomes Project. Because of this, we could use CNVnator for CNV discovery and genotyping in a population and characterization of atypical CNVs, such as de novo and multi-allelic events. Overall, for CNVs accessible by RD, CNVnator has high sensitivity (86{\%}-96{\%}), low false-discovery rate (3{\%}-20{\%}), high genotyping accuracy (93{\%}-95{\%}), and high resolution in breakpoint discovery ({\textless}200 bp in 90{\%} of cases with high sequencing coverage). Furthermore, CNVnator is complementary in a straightforward way to split-read and read-pair approaches: It misses CNVs created by retrotransposable elements, but more than half of the validated CNVs that it identifies are not detected by split-read or read-pair. By genotyping CNVs in the CEPH, Yoruba, and Chinese-Japanese populations, we estimated that at least 11{\%} of all CNV loci involve complex, multi-allelic events, a considerably higher estimate than reported earlier. Moreover, among these events, we observed cases with allele distribution strongly deviating from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, possibly implying selection on certain complex loci. Finally, by combining discovery and genotyping, we identified six potential de novo CNVs in two family trios.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A 6 bp deletion polymorphism in the thymidylate synthase (TS) gene was investigated in order to determine its function. METHODS: A luciferase system was used to investigate the function of the 6 bp/1494 polymorphism in vitro. A group of 43 patients with colorectal carcinoma were evaluated for the 6 bp/1494 polymorphism and for intratumoral TS mRNA levels in vivo. RESULTS: The 3'UTR of TS containing the +6 bp polymorphism resulted in an approximate 35{\%} decrease in luciferase activity and mRNA levels, while the TS-3'UTR bearing the -6 bp deletion resulted in an approximate 70{\%} decrease in luciferase activity and mRNA levels. The TS-3'UTR construct containing the -6 bp/1494 deletion also had a higher rate of message degradation compared to the +6 bp/1494 construct. Individuals homozygous for the insertion (+6 bp/+6 bp) had significantly higher TS mRNA levels compared to individuals that were homozygous for the deletion (-6 bp/-6 bp) (P {\textless} 0.007). We determined the frequency of the -6 bp/1494 deletion polymorphism to be 41{\%} in non-Hispanic whites, 26{\%} in Hispanic whites, 52{\%} in African-Americans and 76{\%} in Singapore Chinese. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the -6 bp/1494 deletion polymorphism in the 3'UTR of TS is associated with decreased mRNA stability in vitro and lower intratumoral TS expression in vivo. Further, the 6 bp/1494 polymorphism varies greatly within different ethnic populations and is in linkage disequilibrium with the TS 5' tandem repeat enhancer polymorphism. Taken together, these data suggest that the 6 bp/1494 polymorphism may be a useful screening tool in predicting TS mRNA expression.},

abstract = {The incidence of endometrial cancer, a common gynecological malignancy, is increasing in Japan. We have previously shown that the ER/MDM2/p53/p21 pathway plays an important role in endometrial carcinogenesis. In the present study, we investigated the effects of germline single nucleotide polymorphisms in murine double minute 2 (MDM2) SNP309, TP53 Arg72Pro, ESR1 PvuII and XbaI, and p21 codon 31 on endometrial cancer risk. We evaluated these polymorphisms in DNA samples from 125 endometrial cancer cases and 200 controls using polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism. The association of each genetic polymorphism with endometrial cancer was examined by the odds ratio and 95{\%} confidence interval, which were obtained using logistic regression analysis. The SNP309 GG genotype non-significantly increased the risk of endometrial cancer. The 95{\%} confidence interval for the GG genotype vs. the TT genotype of MDM2 SNP309 was 1.76 (0.93-3.30). Endometrial cancer was not associated with tested SNP genotypes for TP53, ESR1 and p21. The combination of SNP309 GG + TG and TP53 codon 72 Arg/Arg significantly increased endometrial cancer risk. The adjusted OR was 2.53 (95{\%} confidence interval, 1.03-6.21) and P for the interaction was 0.04. This result was supported by in vitro data showing that endometrial cancer cell lines with the SNP309 G allele failed to show growth inhibition by treatment with RITA, which reduces p53-MDM2 binding. The presence of the SNP309 G allele and TP53 codon 72 Arg/Arg genotype is associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer in Japanese women.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Assessment of DNA integrity and quantity remains a bottleneck for high-throughput molecular genotyping technologies, including next-generation sequencing. In particular, DNA extracted from paraffin-embedded tissues, a major potential source of tumor DNA, varies widely in quality, leading to unpredictable sequencing data. We describe a picoliter droplet-based digital PCR method that enables simultaneous detection of DNA integrity and the quantity of amplifiable DNA.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Using a multiplex assay, we detected 4 different target lengths (78, 159, 197, and 550 bp). Assays were validated with human genomic DNA fragmented to sizes of 170 bp to 3000 bp. The technique was validated with DNA quantities as low as 1 ng. We evaluated 12 DNA samples extracted from paraffin-embedded lung adenocarcinoma tissues.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: One sample contained no amplifiable DNA. The fractions of amplifiable DNA for the 11 other samples were between 0.05{\%} and 10.1{\%} for 78-bp fragments and ≤1{\%} for longer fragments. Four samples were chosen for enrichment and next-generation sequencing. The quality of the sequencing data was in agreement with the results of the DNA-integrity test. Specifically, DNA with low integrity yielded sequencing results with lower levels of coverage and uniformity and had higher levels of false-positive variants.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The development of DNA-quality assays will enable researchers to downselect samples or process more DNA to achieve reliable genome sequencing with the highest possible efficiency of cost and effort, as well as minimize the waste of precious samples.},

abstract = {Preservation of macromolecules (DNA, RNA, and proteins) in tissue is traditionally achieved by immediate freezing of the sample. Although isolation of PCR-able RNA has been reported from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues, the process has not been shown to be reproducible because high molecular weight RNA is usually degraded. We investigated the potential value of a new universal molecular fixative (UMFIX, Sakura Finetek USA, Inc., Torrance, California) in preservation of macromolecules in paraffin-embedded tissue. Mouse and human tissues were fixed in UMFIX from 1 hour to 8 weeks. They were then processed by a rapid tissue processing (RTP) system, embedded in paraffin, and evaluated for routine histology as well as for the quality and quantity of DNA, RNA, and proteins. Formalin-fixed tissues were processed by RTP and evaluated in a similar manner. Fresh-frozen samples were used as controls. The morphology of UMFIX-exposed tissue was comparable to that fixed in formalin. High molecular weight RNA was preserved in tissue that was immediately fixed in UMFIX and stored from 1 hour to 8 weeks at room temperature. There were no significant differences between UMFIX-exposed and frozen tissues on PCR, RT-PCR, real-time PCR, and expression microarrays. Similarly, physical and antigenic preservation of proteins in UMFIX tissue was similar to fresh state. Both RNA and proteins were substantially degraded in formalin-fixed and similarly processed specimens. We concluded that it is now possible to preserve histomorphology and intact macromolecules in the same archival paraffin-embedded tissue through the use of a novel fixative and a rapid processing system.},

abstract = {Glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) participates in detoxification of potentially genotoxic compounds that may alter the efficacy and toxicity of platinum-based chemotherapy. We analyzed the influence of I105V polymorphism of GSTP1 on clinico-pathological features and outcomes in 166 Chinese patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma who had been treated with first-line FOLFOX-4. Combined analysis of GSTP1 I105V, ERCC1-118, and XPD-751 polymorphisms was also conducted. The results showed that, in comparison with Caucasian populations, a remarkably lower prevalence of Val105 allele variants was noted (24.7{\%}). Patients with Val105 allele variants had a higher response to FOLFOX-4 (56.1{\%}vs 37.6{\%}, P = 0.04), and a longer progression-free (P {\textless} 0.01) as well as overall (P {\textless} 0.01) survival. By adjusted analysis, this polymorphism was identified as an independent prognostic factor (P = 0.01). In combined analysis, patients without any risk genotype, including GSTP1-105 Ile/Ile, ERCC1-118 C/T or T/T, and XPD-751 Lys/Gln, had significantly longer progression-free and overall survivals (P {\textless} 0.01). In addition, patients with Val105 allele variants had a higher incidence of grade 3/4 cumulative neuropathy after different cycles of treatment. These data suggest that Asian populations have a lower prevalence of I105V polymorphism in GSTP1. I105V polymorphism in GSTP1, by reducing its enzymatic activity and consequential detoxification to oxaliplatin, could be a key determinant for a better outcome, but more neurotoxicity, to FOLFOX-4 treatment.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The polymorphism of p53 codon 72 (Arg72Pro) has been suggested to play an important role in many cancers and may influence the response to chemotherapy. Our aim was to investigate the association of p53 Arg72Pro polymorphism with the clinical outcome of gastric cancer patients treated with 5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy. METHODS: The p53 codon 72 genotype was determined in blood samples from 110 Chinese patients with gastric cancer treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based adjuvant chemotherapy, using polymerase chain reaction-ligation detection reaction (PCR-LDR) method. RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that gastric cancer patients with Pro/Pro genotype had shorter relapse-free survival (chi(2) = 10.632, P = 0.005) and overall survival (chi(2) = 7.104, P = 0.029) than patients with other genotypes. Cox multivariate analysis showed that Pro/Pro genotype was associated with statistically significant reduced relapse-free survival (adjusted OR = 3.049, 95{\%} CI: 1.363-6.819, P = 0.007) and overall survival (adjusted OR = 2.581, 95{\%} CI: 1.052-6.330, P = 0.038). CONCLUSION: These results suggested that p53 codon 72 polymorphism appears to be an independent prognostic factor in gastric cancer patients treated with 5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy.},

abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this study was to explore genetic counselors' information preferences on reports of variant of uncertain significance (VUS) results from cancer genetic testing. Methods: This mixed methods report (quantitative and qualitative approaches) utilized a survey of genetic counselors containing closed- and open-ended questions to explore genetic counselors' information needs and perceptions of the industry's current information sharing practices. Descriptive statistics were calculated for responses to the closed-ended questions, and thematic analysis guided the interpretation of the open-ended questions. Results: Of the 267 participants (28.6{\%} response rate), the majority indicated a perceived lack of information on VUS laboratory reports, were concerned about the perceived practice of withholding information, and stated the information they wanted to see. Although most did not indicate how additional information would be used, some reported they would provide information directly to patients, and others reported that the information would be used to contextualize the VUS result when counseling patients. Conclusion: This analysis identified information that genetic counselors believe is needed in VUS reports, indicating what they believe are best practices in lieu of guidelines for laboratories currently providing genetic testing services.

We assessed, under current practice patterns, frequency and severity of CT-induced toxicity and its economic consequences.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospective, multicentre, longitudinal, observational cohort study with lymphoproliferative disorder (LPD) and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, receiving first- or second-line (immuno-) CT (excluding myeloablative CT). Data were collected from patient interviews and preplanned chart reviews. Costs in 2007 euros are presented from the provider perspective.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Two hundred and seventy-three patients (n = 153 LPD; n = 120 NSCLC) undergoing a total of 1004 CT cycles were assessable (age ≥65 years, 40{\%}; female, 36{\%}; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≥2, 11{\%}; tumour stage ≥III, 56{\%}; history of comorbidity, 80{\%}). Fifty percent of cycles were associated with grade 3/4 toxicity and 37{\%} (n = 371) with at least one hospital stay (outpatient/day care n = 154; intensive care n = 19). Mean (median) toxicity-related costs amounted to €1032 (€86) per cycle. Costs rose exponentially with the number of grade 3/4 adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and were highest in cycles affected by more than four ADRs, €10 881 (€5455); in cycles with intensive care, €14 121 (€8833); and in cycles affected by grade 3/4 infections and febrile neutropenia/leukopenia, €7093 (€4531) and €5170 (€2899), respectively. Five percent of CT cycles accounted for 56{\%} of total expenses.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Individualised supportive care strategies are needed. Future research should focus on identifying toxicity clusters and patient characteristics predictive for high costs.},

This reservoir of specimens is increasingly being used for DNA, RNA, and proteomic analyses. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the impact of preanalytical factors associated with the formalin fixation and paraffin embedding process on downstream morphological and molecular endpoints. DATA SOURCES We surveyed the existing literature using the National Cancer Institute's Biospecimen Research Database for published reports investigating the potential influence of preanalytical factors associated with the formalin fixation and paraffin embedding process on DNA, RNA, protein, and morphological endpoints. CONCLUSIONS Based on the literature evidence, the molecular, proteomic, and morphological endpoints can be altered in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens by suboptimal processing conditions. While the direction and magnitude of effects associated with a given preanalytical factor were dependent on the analyte (DNA, RNA, protein, and morphology) and analytical platform, acceptable conditions are highlighted, and a summary of conditions that could preclude analysis is provided.},

Before there can be widespread uptake of these tests, they must be evaluated to confirm the benefits of their use. But how should genetic tests be evaluated, given the speed at which new tests are emerging? One highly influential approach is the analytic validity, clinical validity, clinical utility and ethical, legal and social issues (ACCE) framework, which has provided a benchmark for the evaluation of genetic tests. The approach has been adopted and adapted by the United Kingdom Genetic Testing Network, with the help of the Public Health Genetics Unit in Cambridge, to evaluate new genetic tests for use in the National Health Service. We discuss a number of conceptual, methodological, and practical issues concerning the evaluation of genetic tests, based on lessons learned from applying the ACCE framework and from the UK experience, and make a number of recommendations to further strengthen the evaluation of genetic tests.},

abstract = {AIMS: The importance of polymorphisms in the dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase gene (DPYD) for the prediction of severe toxicity in 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy is still unclear. This study aims to assess the predictive value of DPYD variation with respect to previously described DPYD variants for 5-FU toxicity. It represents the first analysis of the gene at the haplotype level, also capturing potentially important genetic variation located outside the coding regions of DPYD. MATERIALS {\&} METHODS: The entire coding sequence and exon-flanking intronic regions of DPYD were sequenced in 111 cancer patients receiving fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. DPYD haplotypes were inferred and their associations with severe 5-FU toxicity were assessed. RESULTS: None of the previously described deleterious variants (IVS14+1G{\textgreater}A, c.2846A{\textgreater}T and c.1679T{\textgreater}G) were detected in 24 patients who experienced severe 5-FU toxicity. A potential association was observed between a haplotype containing three novel intronic polymorphisms (IVS5+18G{\textgreater}A, IVS6+139G{\textgreater}A and IVS9-51T{\textgreater}G) and a synonymous mutation (c.1236G{\textgreater}A), which was observed five- out of eight-times in patients with severe adverse effects. CONCLUSION: The association of a haplotype containing no nonsynonymous or splice-site polymorphisms indicates that additional important genetic variation may be located in noncoding gene regions. Furthermore, a comparison with other studies suggests that the relative importance of particular DPYD mutations (IVS14+1G{\textgreater}A and c.2846A{\textgreater}T) for predicting severe 5-FU toxicity differs geographically across Europe.},

A total of 182 patients with NIS, 103 patients with chronic hepatitis C, and 118 control subjects were enrolled in the study. Of the 35 SNPs studied, 3 were in IFN-[alpha] receptor (IFNAR-1), 10 in IFN-[alpha]/[beta] receptor (IFNAR-2), 9 in Statl, 5 in Stat2, and 8 in IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1). Compared to controls, Statl gene polymorphisms were significantly more frequent in NIS patients (rs{\#} 2066802 OR = 7.46, 95{\%} CI = 2.22-25.10; rs{\#} 1547550 OR = 1.69, 95{\%} CI = 1.01-2.81) and in HCV patients (rs{\#} 2066802 OR = 5.95, 95{\%} CI = 1.55-22.81; rs{\#} 1547550 OR = 2.30, 95{\%} CI = 1.24-4.24). Also one IRF-1 gene SNP was associated with NIS (rs{\#} 2070721 OR = 2.05, 95{\%} CI = 1.03-4.09), and four IRF-1 gene SNPs were associated with HCV infection (rs{\#}2070721 OR = 2.59, 95{\%} CI = 1.23-5.43; rs{\#} 2070723 OR = 4.8, 95{\%} CI = 1.26-18.20; rs{\#} 2070728 OR = 9.81, 95{\%} CI = 1.2179.4; rs{\#} 2070729 OR = 3.6, 95{\%} CI = 1.23-10.48; rs{\#} 839 OR = 4.67, 95{\%}CI = 1.29-16.87). Characteristic nucleotide combinations on single chromosomes (haplotype) generated block structures, including SNPs, that differed between patients and controls. Using a permutation test to detect differences in haplotype distribution between groups, the CCATTGA and the CCGAA haplotypes in the IRF-1 gene were more frequent in NIS (p = 0.03) and in HCV patients (p = 0.001) than in controls. In conclusion, our data show that genetic variants in the IRF-1 and Statl genes of the IFN pathway are associated with NIS and HCV infection.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: An increasing number of studies show that genetic markers can aid in refining prognostic information and predicting the benefit from systemic therapy. Our goal was to develop a high throughput, cost-effective and simple methodology for the detection of clinically relevant hot spot mutations in colon cancer. METHODS: The Maldi-Tof mass spectrometry platform and OncoCarta panel from Sequenom were used to profile 239 colon cancers and 39 metastatic lymph nodes from NSABP clinical trial C-07 utilizing routinely processed FFPET (formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue). RESULTS: Among the 238 common hot-spot cancer mutations in 19 genes interrogated by the OncoCarta panel, mutations were detected in 7 different genes at 26 different nucleotide positions in our colon cancer samples. Twenty-four assays that detected mutations in more than 1{\%} of the samples were reconfigured into a new multiplexed panel, termed here as ColoCarta. Mutation profiling was repeated on 32 mutant samples using ColoCarta and the results were identical to results with OncoCarta, demonstrating that this methodology was reproducible. Further evidence demonstrating the validity of the data was the fact that the mutation frequencies of the most common colon cancer mutations were similar to the COSMIC (Catalog of Somatic Mutations in Cancer) database. The frequencies were 43.5{\%} for KRAS, 20.1{\%} for PIK3CA, and 12.1{\%} for BRAF. In addition, infrequent mutations in NRAS, AKT1, ABL1, and MET were detected. Mutation profiling of metastatic lymph nodes and their corresponding primary tumors showed that they were 89.7{\%} concordant. All mutations found in the lymph nodes were also found in the corresponding primary tumors, but in 4 cases a mutation was present in the primary tumor only. CONCLUSIONS: This study describes a high throughput technology that can be used to interrogate DNAs isolated from routinely processed FFPET and identifies the specific mutations that are common to colon cancer. The development of this technology and the ColoCarta panel may provide a mechanism for rapid screening of mutations in clinically relevant genes like KRAS, PIK3CA, and BRAF.

A hospital-based case-control study consisting of 444 patients and 569 controls was conducted to explore the associations between TP53 Arg72Pro and MDM2 T309G and CRC risk in Chinese. The combined effect of TP53 Arg72Pro and MDM2 T309G was significant in a gene dose-response increasing CRC risk (trend test: P = 0.02). Individuals carrying 3 or more potential risk alleles had 1.78 times risk (95 {\%} CI: 1.13-2.80) to develop CRC compared with individuals without potential risk allele. This increased cancer risk was more pronounced in smokers who carried 3-4 potential risk alleles (OR = 2.75, 95 {\%} CI: 1.14-6.60) and in young subjects (OR = 2.05, 95 {\%} CI: 1.08-3.88). The gene-gene interaction between TP53 Arg72Pro and MDM2 T309G may interact in carcinogenesis of CRC in Chinese, especially in smokers, and this kind of interaction is associated with onset age of CRC.},

More than 100 of these genes have been identified, providing important scientific insights in many areas, particularly the mechanisms of cancer causation. Moreover, clinical utilization of cancer predisposition genes has had a substantial impact on diagnosis, optimized management and prevention of cancer. The recent transformative advances in DNA sequencing hold the promise of many more cancer predisposition gene discoveries, and greater and broader clinical applications. However, there is also considerable potential for incorrect inferences and inappropriate clinical applications. Realizing the promise of cancer predisposition genes for science and medicine will thus require careful navigation.},

abstract = {Non-reproducible sequence artefacts are frequently detected in DNA from formalinfixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. However, no rational strategy has been developed for reduction of sequence artefacts from FFPE DNA as the underlying causes of the artefacts are poorly understood. As cytosine deamination to uracil is a common form of DNA damage in ancient DNA, we set out to examine whether treatment of FFPE DNA with uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) would lead to the reduction of C{\textgreater}T (and G{\textgreater}A) sequence artefacts. Heteroduplex formation in high resolution melting (HRM)-based assays was used for the detection of sequence variants in FFPE DNA samples. A set of samples that gave false positive HRM results for screening for the E17K mutation in exon 4 of the AKT1 gene were chosen for analysis. Sequencing of these samples showed multiple non-reproducible C:G{\textgreater}T:A artefacts. Treatment of the FFPE DNA with UDG prior to PCR amplification led to a very marked reduction of the sequence artefacts as indicated by both HRM and sequencing analysis, indicating that uracil lesions are the major cause of sequence artefacts. Similar results were shown for the BRAF V600 region in the same sample set and EGFR exon 19 in another sample set. UDG treatment specifically suppressed the formation of artefacts in FFPE DNA as it did not affect the detection of true KRAS codon 12 and true EGFR exon 19 and 20 mutations. We conclude that uracil in FFPE DNA leads to a significant proportion of sequence artefacts. These can be minimised by a simple UDG pretreatment which can be readily carried out, in the same tube, as the PCR immediately prior to commencing thermal cycling. HRM is a convenient way of monitoring both the degree of damage and the effectiveness of the UDG treatment. These findings have immediate and important implications for cancer diagnostics where FFPE DNA is used as the primary genetic material for mutational studies guiding personalised medicine strategies and where simple effective strategies to detect mutations are required.},

abstract = {Cancer predisposition syndromes are typically uncommon, monogenic, high-penetrance disorders. Despite their rarity, they have proven to be highly clinically relevant in directing cancer prevention strategies. As such, they share notable similarities with an expanding class of low-frequency somatic mutations that are associated with a striking prognostic or predictive effect in the tumours in which they occur. In this review, we highlight these commonalities, with particular reference to mutations in the proofreading domain of replicative DNA polymerases. These molecular phenotypes may occur as either germline or somatic events, and in the latter case, have been shown to confer a favourable prognosis and potential increased benefit from immune checkpoint inhibition. We note that incorporation of these variants into clinical management algorithms will help refine patient management, and that this will be further improved by the inclusion of other germline variants, such as those that determine the likelihood of benefit or toxicity from anti-neoplastic therapy. Finally, we propose that such integrated patient and tumour profiling will be essential if we are to deliver truly precision medicine for cancer patients, but in a similar way to rare germline mutations, we must ensure that we identify and utilize rare somatic mutations with strong predictive and prognostic effects.

abstract = {Inactivation of the tumour-suppressor gene p53 has been described as one of the most common molecular changes found in lung tumours. Our purpose was to study the prognostic value of p53 alterations and to determine whether some specific mutation type in the p53 gene could be associated with poor clinical evolution in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. To this end, we studied 81 resected primary NSCLCs in order to detect p53 alterations. p53 protein accumulation was analysed using immunohistochemistry methods; p53 gene mutations in exons 5-9 were studied using polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism and sequencing techniques. p53 protein was immunodetected in 46.9{\%} of lung carcinomas and 44.7{\%} of p53-immunopositive tumours showed p53 mutations. Survival analysis was performed on 62 patients. No survival differences were found for patients with or without p53 immunopositivity. A shorter survival was found in patients with underlying p53 gene mutations, mainly in patients with squamous cell lung tumours; the worst prognosis was found when mutations were located in exon 5 (P = 0.007). In conclusion, the location of p53 mutations might be considered as a prognostic indicator for the evaluation of poor clinical evolution in NSCLC patients.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND PCR amplicon sequencing has been widely used as a targeted approach for both DNA and RNA sequence analysis. High multiplex PCR has further enabled the enrichment of hundreds of amplicons in one simple reaction. At the same time, the performance of PCR amplicon sequencing can be negatively affected by issues such as high duplicate reads, polymerase artifacts and PCR amplification bias. Recently researchers have made some good progress in addressing these shortcomings by incorporating molecular barcodes into PCR primer design. So far, most work has been demonstrated using one to a few pairs of primers, which limits the size of the region one can analyze. RESULTS We developed a simple protocol, which enables the use of molecular barcodes in high multiplex PCR with hundreds of amplicons. Using this protocol and reference materials, we demonstrated the applications in accurate variant calling at very low fraction over a large region and in targeted RNA quantification. We also evaluated the protocol's utility in profiling FFPE samples. CONCLUSIONS We demonstrated the successful implementation of molecular barcodes in high multiplex PCR, with multiplex scale many times higher than earlier work. We showed that the new protocol combines the benefits of both high multiplex PCR and molecular barcodes, i.e. the analysis of a very large region, low DNA input requirement, very good reproducibility and the ability to detect as low as 1{\%} mutations with minimal false positives (FP).},

abstract = {Whole-genome and exome sequencing have already proven to be essential and powerful methods to identify genes responsible for simple Mendelian inherited disorders. These methods can be applied to complex disorders as well, and have been adopted as one of the current mainstream approaches in population genetics. These achievements have been made possible by next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, which require substantial bioinformatics resources to analyze the dense and complex sequence data. The huge analytical burden of data from genome sequencing might be seen as a bottleneck slowing the publication of NGS papers at this time, especially in psychiatric genetics. We review the existing methods for processing NGS data, to place into context the rationale for the design of a computational resource. We describe our method, the Graphical Pipeline for Computational Genomics (GPCG), to perform the computational steps required to analyze NGS data. The GPCG implements flexible workflows for basic sequence alignment, sequence data quality control, single nucleotide polymorphism analysis, copy number variant identification, annotation, and visualization of results. These workflows cover all the analytical steps required for NGS data, from processing the raw reads to variant calling and annotation. The current version of the pipeline is freely available at http://pipeline.loni.ucla.edu. These applications of NGS analysis may gain clinical utility in the near future (e.g., identifying miRNA signatures in diseases) when the bioinformatics approach is made feasible. Taken together, the annotation tools and strategies that have been developed to retrieve information and test hypotheses about the functional role of variants present in the human genome will help to pinpoint the genetic risk factors for psychiatric disorders.},

abstract = {Recent advances in genome sequencing technologies provide unprecedented opportunities to characterize individual genomic landscapes and identify mutations relevant for diagnosis and therapy. Specifically, whole-exome sequencing using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies is gaining popularity in the human genetics community due to the moderate costs, manageable data amounts and straightforward interpretation of analysis results. While whole-exome and, in the near future, whole-genome sequencing are becoming commodities, data analysis still poses significant challenges and led to the development of a plethora of tools supporting specific parts of the analysis workflow or providing a complete solution. Here, we surveyed 205 tools for whole-genome/whole-exome sequencing data analysis supporting five distinct analytical steps: quality assessment, alignment, variant identification, variant annotation and visualization. We report an overview of the functionality, features and specific requirements of the individual tools. We then selected 32 programs for variant identification, variant annotation and visualization, which were subjected to hands-on evaluation using four data sets: one set of exome data from two patients with a rare disease for testing identification of germline mutations, two cancer data sets for testing variant callers for somatic mutations, copy number variations and structural variations, and one semi-synthetic data set for testing identification of copy number variations. Our comprehensive survey and evaluation of NGS tools provides a valuable guideline for human geneticists working on Mendelian disorders, complex diseases and cancers.},

abstract = {Next-generation sequencing is being adopted as a diagnostic test to identify actionable mutations in cancer patient samples. However, clinical samples such as formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded specimens frequently provide low quantities of degraded, poor quality DNA. To overcome these issues, many sequencing assays rely on extensive PCR amplification leading to an accumulation of bias and artifacts. Thus, there is a need for a targeted sequencing assay that performs well with DNA of low quality and quantity without relying on extensive PCR amplification. We evaluated the performance of a targeted sequencing assay based on Oligonucleotide Selective Sequencing. This assay enables on to sequence and call variants from low amounts of damaged DNA. This assay utilizes a repair process developed to sequence clinical FFPE samples, followed by adaptor ligation to single stranded DNA and a primer-based capture technique. This approach generates sequence libraries of high fidelity without relying heavily on PCR amplification, and facilitates the assessment of copy number alterations across the target regions. Using an assay designed to capture the exons of a panel of 130 actionable cancer genes, we obtain an on-target rate of {\textgreater}50{\%} and high uniformity across targeted regions at starting input DNA amounts of 10ng per sample. We demonstrate the performance of this targeted sequencing assay using a series of reference DNA samples, and in variant identification from low quality DNA samples originating from different tissue types.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Whole genome and exome sequencing of matched tumor-normal sample pairs is becoming routine in cancer research. The consequent increased demand for somatic variant analysis of paired samples requires methods specialized to model this problem so as to sensitively call variants at any practical level of tumor impurity.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We describe Strelka, a method for somatic SNV and small indel detection from sequencing data of matched tumor-normal samples. The method uses a novel Bayesian approach which represents continuous allele frequencies for both tumor and normal samples, while leveraging the expected genotype structure of the normal. This is achieved by representing the normal sample as a mixture of germline variation with noise, and representing the tumor sample as a mixture of the normal sample with somatic variation. A natural consequence of the model structure is that sensitivity can be maintained at high tumor impurity without requiring purity estimates. We demonstrate that the method has superior accuracy and sensitivity on impure samples compared with approaches based on either diploid genotype likelihoods or general allele-frequency tests.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY: The Strelka workflow source code is available at ftp://strelka@ftp.illumina.com/.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONTACT: csaunders@illumina.com},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutations have excellent response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), and exon 20 mutation accounts for most of TKI drug resistance. Nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect EGFR exon 20 mutations of patients with NSCLC after chemotherapy. The same is being analyzed with patients' characteristics.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Peripheral blood samples were collected from 273 patients with NSCLC, including 143 with adenocarcinoma (ADC) and 130 with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), after chemotherapy. DNA was extracted from whole blood for nested PCR amplification and purification. Sequencing was carried out in an automated 3730 sequencer, followed by analysis of EGFR exon 20 mutations from nested PCR products.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The mutations of EGFR exon 20 were mainly point mutations in rs1050171 (c.2361A{\textgreater}G) and rs56183713 (c.2457G{\textgreater}A). The point mutation was 28.21{\%}, 28.46{\%}, and 27.97{\%} in patients with NSCLC, ADC and SCC, respectively. Men had an equivalent mutation (27.18{\%}) to women (30.77{\%}). The mutation in smokers and nonsmokers was 27.68{\%} and 29.17{\%}, respectively. In unselected patients, there was no correlation between EGFR exon 20 mutations and patients' characteristics of age, gender, smoking history, histologic type, or tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system. In subgroup analyses, the EGFR mutation of patients with SCC was correlated with TNM stage [P = .013; odds ratio = 1.758; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) = 1.125-2.747].$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that the chemotherapy may induce EGFR-TKI-resistant mutation in NSCLC cells and EGFR-TKI should be used in the early stage of NSCLC but not after chemotherapy.},

She had no cardiac risk factors, and neither laboratory nor imaging findings suggested myocarditis or dilated cardiomyopathy. Echocardiographic findings and differential diagnosis led us to attribute her condition to late doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy. By virtue of tapered medical therapy, her left ventricular ejection fraction improved from 0.20 to 0.55 in 8 months, and she was asymptomatic after 1 year. The reversibility of left ventricular dysfunction in our patient and the very late appearance of cardiotoxicity secondary to doxorubicin therapy raise questions about the pathogenesis and prevalence of late doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy and how to improve outcomes in patients who present with related symptoms of heart failure.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Due to its low cost, amplicon sequencing, also known as ultra-deep targeted sequencing, is now becoming widely used in oncology for detection of actionable mutations, i.e. mutations influencing cell sensitivity to targeted therapies. Amplicon sequencing is based on the PCR amplification of the regions of interest, a process that considerably distorts the information on copy numbers initially present in the tumor DNA. Therefore, additional experiments such as SNP or CGH arrays often complement amplicon sequencing in clinics in order to identify copy number status of genes whose amplification or deletion has direct consequences on the efficacy of a particular cancer treatment. So far there has been no proven method to extract the information on gene copy number aberrations based solely on amplicon sequencing.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Here we present ONCOCNV, a method that includes a multi-factor normalization and annotation technique enabling the detection of large copy number changes from amplicon sequencing data. We validated our approach on high and low amplicon density datasets and demonstrated that ONCOCNV can achieve a precision comparable to that of array CGH techniques in detecting copy number aberrations. Thus, ONCOCNV applied on amplicon sequencing data would make the use of additional array CGH or SNP array experiments unnecessary.

abstract = {Tumor analyses commonly employ a correction with a matched normal (MN), a sample from healthy tissue of the same individual, in order to distinguish germline mutations from somatic mutations. Since the majority of variants found in an individual are thought to be common within the population, we constructed a set of 931 samples from healthy, unrelated individuals, originating from two different sequencing platforms, to serve as a virtual normal (VN) in the absence of such an associated normal sample. Our approach removed (1) {\textgreater}96{\%} of the germline variants also removed by the MN sample and (2) a large number (2{\%}-8{\%}) of additional variants not corrected for by the associated normal. The combination of the VN with the MN improved the correction for polymorphisms significantly, with up to ∼30{\%} compared with MN and ∼15{\%} compared with VN only. We determined the number of unrelated genomes needed in order to correct at least as efficiently as the MN is about 200 for structural variations (SVs) and about 400 for single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and indels. In addition, we propose that the removal of common variants with purely position-based methods is inaccurate and incurs additional false-positive somatic variants, and more sophisticated algorithms, which are capable of leveraging information about the area surrounding variants, are needed for optimal accuracy. Our VN correction method can be used to analyze any list of variants, regardless of sequencing platform of origin. This VN methodology is available for use on our public Galaxy server.},

abstract = {The field of medical genomics involves translating high throughput genetic methods to the clinic, in order to improve diagnostic efficiency and treatment decision making. Technical questions related to sample enrichment, sequencing methodologies and variant identification and calling algorithms, still need careful investigation in order to validate the analytical step of next generation sequencing techniques for clinical applications. However, the main foreseeable challenge will be interpreting the clinical significance of the variants observed in a given patient, as well as their significance for family members and for other patients.Every step in the variant interpretation process has limitations and difficulties, and its quote of contribution to false positive and false negative results. There is no single piece of evidence enough on its own to make firm conclusions on the pathogenicity and disease causality of a given variant.A plethora of automated analysis software tools is being developed that will enhance efficiency and accuracy. However a risk of misinterpretation could derive from biased biorepository content, facilitated by annotation of variant functional consequences using previous datasets stored in the same or linked repositories. In order to improve variant interpretation and avoid an exponential accumulation of confounding noise in the medical literature, the use of terms in a standard way should be sought and requested when reporting genetic variants and their consequences. Generally, stepwise and linear interpretation processes are likely to overrate some pieces of evidence while underscoring others. Algorithms are needed that allow a multidimensional, parallel analysis of diverse lines of evidence to be carried out by expert teams for specific genes, cellular pathways or disorders.},

Counseling for uninformative BRCA-negative (UN) results is thought to be more straightforward, despite the fact that both results lead to similar methods of empiric cancer risk counseling. This study compared surgical choices and perceptions between 71 patients with VUS results and 714 patients with UN results. All patients underwent genetic counseling because of a personal or family history of breast or ovarian cancer between 1997 and 2010, and completed a 2-year follow-up survey. Risk-reducing mastectomy rates in both groups were 7{\%} (p = 1.00) and risk-reducing oophorectomy rates were 5{\%} and 3{\%}, respectively (p = 0.42). The VUS group reported less cancer distress reduction than the UN group (23.0{\%} vs 35.8{\%}, respectively, p = 0.043). Over 90{\%} of both groups found the counseling process helpful. Overall, the study suggests that VUS results disclosed in genetic counseling did not cause excessive surgery or exaggerated cancer distress, though patients with a VUS found counseling somewhat less informative or reassuring. Future research on communication of VUS results, including pre-and post-test counseling, is essential for full realization of the potential for genomic medicine.},

First, using various amounts of input DNA, we compared commercially available library construction kits and selected Agilent's SureSelect-XT and KAPA Biosystems' Hyper Prep kits as the kits most compatible with targeted deep sequencing using Agilent's SureSelect custom capture. Then, we optimized the adapter ligation conditions of the Hyper Prep kit to improve library construction efficiency and adapted multiplexed hybrid selection to reduce the cost of sequencing. In this study, we systematically evaluated the performance of the optimized protocol depending on the amount of input DNA, ranging from 6.25 to 200 ng, suggesting the minimal input DNA amounts based on coverage depths required for specific applications.},

abstract = {Background and Objectives—As next generation sequencing (NGS) becomes a major sequencing platform in clinical diagnostic laboratories, it is critical to identify artifacts that constitute baseline noise and may interfere with detection of low level gene mutations. This is especially critical for applications requiring ultrasensitive detection, such as molecular relapse of solid tumors and early detection of cancer. We recently observed approximately {\~{}}10-fold higher C:G {\textgreater} T:A mutations than other background noise in both wild type peripheral blood and formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples. We hypothesized that these might represent cytosine deamination events that have been seen using other platforms. Methods—To test the hypothesis, we pretreated samples with uracil N-glycosylase (UNG). Additionally, we also tested whether some of the cytosine deamination might be laboratory artifact by simulating the heat associated with PCR thermocyling by subjecting samples to thermocycling in the absence of polymerase. To test the safety of universal UNG pretreatment, we tested known positive samples treated with UNG. Results—UNG pretreatment significantly reduced these mutations, consistent with a biologic source for the cytosine deamination. The simulated thermocycling heated samples demonstrated significantly increased C:G {\textgreater} T:A mutations without affecting other baseline base substitutions. Samples with known mutations demonstrated no decrease in our ability to detect these after treatment with UNG. Conclusions—Baseline noise during NGS is mostly due to cytosine deamination, the source of which is likely both biologic and an artifact of thermocycling, and it can be reduced by UNG pretreatment.},

Existing read mapping software excel in either speed (e.g., BWA, Bowtie, ELAND) or sensitivity (e.g., Novoalign), but not in both. In addition, performance often deteriorates in the presence of sequence variation, particularly so for short insertions and deletions (indels). Here, we present a read mapper, Stampy, which uses a hybrid mapping algorithm and a detailed statistical model to achieve both speed and sensitivity, particularly when reads include sequence variation.

Gastrointestinal dysmotility is the most prominent manifestation, with recurrent diarrhea, borborygmi, and intestinal pseudo-obstruction. Patients usually die in early adulthood (mean, 37.6 years; range, 26-58 years). Cerebral leukodystrophy is characteristic. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has depletion, multiple deletions, or both. We have identified 16 TP mutations. Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations were present in all patients tested. Leukocyte TP activity was reduced drastically in all patients tested, 0.009 +/- 0.021 micromol/hr/mg (mean +/- SD; n = 16), compared with controls, 0.67 +/- 0.21 micromol/hr/mg (n = 19). MNGIE is a recognizable clinical syndrome caused by mutations in thymidine phosphorylase. Severe reduction of TP activity in leukocytes is diagnostic. Altered mitochondrial nucleoside and nucleotide pools may impair mtDNA replication, repair, or both.},

abstract = {Platinum drugs are among the most active and widely used agents in the treatment of different cancers. However, the great individual variability in both outcome and toxicity of platinum chemotherapy requires the identification of genetic markers that can be used to screen patients before treatment. In this study, 21 polymorphisms in 10 genes, the protein activities of which may be addressed in different aspects of cisplatind metabolism, were tested for correlations with efficacy and toxicity of cisplatin-cyclophosphamide regimen in 104 ovarian cancer patients. The glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) Ile105Val polymorphism was strongly associated with progression-free survival (chi(2)=12.12, P=0.002). The allelic status of the GSTA1 -69 C{\textgreater}T polymorphism correlated with the overall survival: patients with T/T genotype survived longer than C/C carriers (P=0.044). Thrombocytopenia, anemia and neuropathy were less frequent among patients with the GSTM1-null or GSTM3 intron 6 AGG/AGG genotypes. Severe neutropenia was associated with the TP53 72 Pro/Pro, XPD 312 Asp/Asn and XRCC1 399 Arg/Arg genotypes. A higher risk of nephrotoxicity was noted for patients with the heterozygous ERCC1 19007 T/C and 8092 C/A genotypes. No correlations were found between genotypes and complete tumor responses.},

abstract = {DNA sequencing by synthesis (SBS) on a solid surface during polymerase reaction can decipher many sequences in parallel. We report here a DNA sequencing method that is a hybrid between the Sanger dideoxynucleotide terminating reaction and SBS. In this approach, four nucleotides, modified as reversible terminators by capping the 3'-OH with a small reversible moiety so that they are still recognized by DNA polymerase as substrates, are combined with four cleavable fluorescent dideoxynucleotides to perform SBS. The ratio of the two sets of nucleotides is adjusted as the extension cycles proceed. Sequences are determined by the unique fluorescence emission of each fluorophore on the DNA products terminated by ddNTPs. On removing the 3'-OH capping group from the DNA products generated by incorporating the 3'-O-modified dNTPs and the fluorophore from the DNA products terminated with the ddNTPs, the polymerase reaction reinitiates to continue the sequence determination. By using an azidomethyl group as a chemically reversible capping moiety in the 3'-O-modified dNTPs, and an azido-based cleavable linker to attach the fluorophores to the ddNTPs, we synthesized four 3'-O-azidomethyl-dNTPs and four ddNTP-azidolinker-fluorophores for the hybrid SBS. After sequence determination by fluorescence imaging, the 3'-O-azidomethyl group and the fluorophore attached to the DNA extension product via the azidolinker are efficiently removed by using Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine in aqueous solution that is compatible with DNA. Various DNA templates, including those with homopolymer regions, were accurately sequenced with a read length of {\textgreater}30 bases by using this hybrid SBS method on a chip and a four-color fluorescence scanner.},

A central challenge to the analysis of this data is sequence alignment, whereby sequence reads must be compared to a reference. A wide variety of alignment algorithms and software have been subsequently developed over the past two years. In this article, we will systematically review the current development of these algorithms and introduce their practical applications on different types of experimental data. We come to the conclusion that short-read alignment is no longer the bottleneck of data analyses. We also consider future development of alignment algorithms with respect to emerging long sequence reads and the prospect of cloud computing.},

abstract = {mTOR regulates several cellular processes that are critical for tumorigenesis. However, previous studies on the association of mTOR polymorphisms with predisposition to different cancer types are somewhat contradictory. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and updated meta-analysis of the available evidence regarding the relationship between mTOR single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and cancer risk. Up to November 2015, 23 original publications were identified covering 20 mTOR SNPs, of which seven SNPs (rs2536, rs2295080, rs1883965, rs1034528, rs17036508, rs3806317 and rs1064261) were included in the final meta-analysis. We estimated the summary odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) for mTOR polymorphisms and cancer risk, and used the model-free approach to investigate the biological effect of each polymorphism. Our meta-analysis found that rs1883965, rs1034528, and rs17036508 were correlated with increased cancer risk in the complete over-dominant model (rs1883965 GA versus GG/AA: fixed-effects OR=1.15, 95{\%} CI 1.02-1.29; rs1034528 GC versus GG/CC: fixed-effects OR=1.30, 95{\%} CI 1.13-1.48; rs17036508 TC versus CC/TT: fixed-effects OR=1.23, 95{\%} CI 1.06-1.43). Stratifying analyses by cancer type, we found that the rs2295080 G allele was associated with a significantly higher risk of acute leukemia in the recessive model (GG versus GT/TT: fixed-effects OR=2.08, 95{\%} CI 1.34-3.22) and a lower risk of genitourinary cancers in the dominant model (TG/GG versus TT: fixed-effects OR=0.77, 95{\%} CI 0.68-0.86). Interestingly, further expression analysis showed that homozygous variant genotype carriers of rs1883965, rs1034528 and rs17036508 had lower mTOR transcript levels, based on HapMap data.},

abstract = {During the course of diagnostic surgical pathology, pathologists have established a large collection of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues that form invaluable resources for translational studies of cancer and a variety of other diseases. Accessibility of macromolecules in the fixed tissue specimens is a critical issue as exemplified by heat-induced antigen retrieval (AR) immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. On the basis of observations that heating may also enhance in situ hybridization (ISH) and the similarity of formalin-induced chemical modifications that occur in protein and in DNA, we designed a study to examine the efficiency of DNA extraction from archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues using an adaptation of the basic principles of the AR technique, i.e., heating the tissue under the influence of different pH values. Archival paraffin blocks of lymph nodes, tonsil, and colon were randomly selected. Each paraffin block was prepared in 34 microtubes. For each paraffin block, one tube was used as a control sample, using a non-heating DNA extraction protocol. The other 33 tubes were tested using a heating protocol under 11 variable pH values (pH 2 to 12) under three different heating conditions (80, 100, and 120C). Evaluation of the results of DNA extraction was carried out by measuring yields by photometry and PCR amplification, as well as kinetic thermocycling (KTC)-PCR methods. In general, lower pH (acid) solutions gave inferior results to solutions at higher pH (alkaline). Heating tissues at a higher temperature and at pH 6-9 gave higher yields of DNA. There appeared to be a peak in terms of highest efficiency of extracted DNA at around pH 9. The average ratios 260:280 of extracted DNA also showed better values for samples heated at 120C. PCR products of three primers showed satisfactory results for DNA extracted from archival paraffin-embedded tissues by heating protocols at pH 6-12, with results that were comparable to the control sample subjected to the standard non-heating, enzymatic DNA extraction method. This study is the first to document the use of heating at an alkaline pH for DNA extraction from archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues, a recommendation based on the principles of AR for protein IHC. These findings may lead to a more effective protocol for DNA extraction from archival paraffin-embedded tissues and may also provide enhanced understanding of changes that occur during formalin-induced modification of nucleic acids.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Human single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most frequent type of genetic variation in human population. One of the most important goals of SNP projects is to understand which human genotype variations are related to Mendelian and complex diseases. Great interest is focused on non-synonymous coding SNPs (nsSNPs) that are responsible of protein single point mutation. nsSNPs can be neutral or disease associated. It is known that the mutation of only one residue in a protein sequence can be related to a number of pathological conditions of dramatic social impact such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Creutzfeldt-Jakob's diseases. The quality and completeness of presently available SNPs databases allows the application of machine learning techniques to predict the insurgence of human diseases due to single point protein mutation starting from the protein sequence. RESULTS: In this paper, we develop a method based on support vector machines (SVMs) that starting from the protein sequence information can predict whether a new phenotype derived from a nsSNP can be related to a genetic disease in humans. Using a dataset of 21 185 single point mutations, 61{\%} of which are disease-related, out of 3587 proteins, we show that our predictor can reach more than 74{\%} accuracy in the specific task of predicting whether a single point mutation can be disease related or not. Our method, although based on less information, outperforms other web-available predictors implementing different approaches.
