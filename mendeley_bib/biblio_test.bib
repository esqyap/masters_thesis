abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Delayed-type diarrhea is a common side effect of irinotecan and is associated with a bacterial-mediated formation of the active irinotecan metabolite SN-38 from its glucuronide conjugate in the intestine. Based on a pilot study, we hypothesized that concomitant administration of the antibiotic neomycin would diminish exposure of the gut to SN-38 and ameliorate the incidence and severity of diarrhea. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were treated with irinotecan in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Eligible patients received irinotecan (350 mg/m(2) once every 3 weeks) combined with neomycin (660 mg three times daily for three consecutive days, starting 2 days before chemotherapy) or combined with placebo. Blood samples were obtained for additional pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenetic analyses. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were evaluable for the toxicity analysis. Baseline patient characteristics, systemic SN-38 exposure, and UGT1A1*28 genotype status (i.e., an additional TA repeat in the promoter region of uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase isoform 1A1) were similar in both arms. Although distribution, severity, and duration of delayed-type diarrhea did not differ significantly between arms, grade 3 diarrhea tended to be less frequent in the neomycin arm. The presence of at least one UGT1A1*28 allele was strongly related to the incidence of grade 2-3 diarrhea. In the neomycin arm, grade 2 nausea was significantly more common. CONCLUSION: Our results do not suggest a major role for neomycin as prophylaxis for irinotecan-induced delayed-type diarrhea. It is suggested that the UGT1A1*28 genotype status could be used as a screening tool for a priori prevention of irinotecan-induced delayed-type diarrhea.},

abstract = {Pre-therapeutic DPYD pharmacogenetic test to prevent fluoropyrimidines (FL)-related toxicities is not yet common practice in medical oncology. We aimed at investigating the clinical validity of DPYD genetic analysis in a large series of oncological patients. Six hundred three cancer patients, treated with FL, have been retrospectively tested for eight DPYD polymorphisms (DPYD-rs3918290, DPYD-rs55886062, DPYD-rs67376798, DPYD-rs2297595, DPYD-rs1801160, DPYD-rs1801158, DPYD-rs1801159, DPYD-rs17376848) for association with Grade ≥3 toxicity, developed within the first three cycles of therapy. DPYD-rs3918290 and DPYD-rs67376798 were associated to Grade ≥3 toxicity after bootstrap validation and Bonferroni correction (p = 0.003, p = 0.048). DPYD-rs55886062 was not significant likely due to its low allelic frequency, nonetheless one out of two heterozygous patients (compound heterozygous with DPYD-rs3918290) died from toxicity after one cycle. Test specificity for the analysis of DPYD-rs3918290, DPYD-rs55886062 and DPYD-rs67376798 was assessed to 99{\%}. Among the seven patients carrying one variant DPYD-rs3918290, DPYD-rs55886062 or DPYD-rs67376798 allele, not developing Grade ≥3 toxicity, 57{\%} needed a FL dose or schedule modification for moderate chronic toxicity. No other DPYD polymorphism was associated with Grade ≥3 toxicity. Our data demonstrate the clinical validity and specificity of the DPYD-rs3918290, DPYD-rs55886062, DPYD-rs67376798 genotyping test to prevent FL-related Grade ≥3 toxicity and to preserve treatment compliance, and support its introduction in the clinical practice.},

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a subtype of breast cancer frequently deficient in DNA repair, we have investigated the susceptibility to acquire copy number variations (CNVs) in DPYD and evaluated their impact on standard adjuvant treatment.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: DPYD CNVs were analysed in 106 TNBC tumour specimens using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis. Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) expression was determined by immunohistochemistry in 146 tumour tissues.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In TNBC, we detected 43 (41{\%}) tumour specimens with genomic deletions and/or duplications within DPYD which were associated with higher histological grade (P=0.006) and with rearrangements in the DNA repair gene BRCA1 (P=0.007). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed low, moderate and high DPD expression in 64{\%}, 29{\%} and 7{\%} of all TNBCs, and in 40{\%}, 53{\%} and 7{\%} of TNBCs with DPYD CNVs, respectively. Irrespective of DPD protein levels, the presence of CNVs was significantly related to longer time to progression in patients who had received 5-FU- and/or anthracycline-based polychemotherapy (hazard ratio=0.26 (95{\%} CI: 0.07-0.91), log-rank P=0.023; adjusted for tumour stage: P=0.037).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Genomic rearrangements in DPYD, rather than aberrant DPD protein levels, reflect a distinct tumour profile associated with prolonged time to progression upon first-line chemotherapy in TNBC.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A 6 bp deletion polymorphism in the thymidylate synthase (TS) gene was investigated in order to determine its function. METHODS: A luciferase system was used to investigate the function of the 6 bp/1494 polymorphism in vitro. A group of 43 patients with colorectal carcinoma were evaluated for the 6 bp/1494 polymorphism and for intratumoral TS mRNA levels in vivo. RESULTS: The 3'UTR of TS containing the +6 bp polymorphism resulted in an approximate 35{\%} decrease in luciferase activity and mRNA levels, while the TS-3'UTR bearing the -6 bp deletion resulted in an approximate 70{\%} decrease in luciferase activity and mRNA levels. The TS-3'UTR construct containing the -6 bp/1494 deletion also had a higher rate of message degradation compared to the +6 bp/1494 construct. Individuals homozygous for the insertion (+6 bp/+6 bp) had significantly higher TS mRNA levels compared to individuals that were homozygous for the deletion (-6 bp/-6 bp) (P {\textless} 0.007). We determined the frequency of the -6 bp/1494 deletion polymorphism to be 41{\%} in non-Hispanic whites, 26{\%} in Hispanic whites, 52{\%} in African-Americans and 76{\%} in Singapore Chinese. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the -6 bp/1494 deletion polymorphism in the 3'UTR of TS is associated with decreased mRNA stability in vitro and lower intratumoral TS expression in vivo. Further, the 6 bp/1494 polymorphism varies greatly within different ethnic populations and is in linkage disequilibrium with the TS 5' tandem repeat enhancer polymorphism. Taken together, these data suggest that the 6 bp/1494 polymorphism may be a useful screening tool in predicting TS mRNA expression.},

abstract = {The P53 tumor suppressor pathway plays an important role in cancer development. The auto-regulatory feedback mechanism of the P53 and MDM2 expression is critical in keeping proper tumor suppressor function of this pathway. This study examined the effect of P53 Arg72Pro variants on transactivation of polymorphic MDM2 promoter (T309G) and their associations with risk of developing gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA) in a Chinese population. Luciferase assays consistently showed a significantly higher activity of the MDM2 309G promoter compared with the MDM2 309T promoter. In cells co-transfected with variant P53 cDNAs, P53-72Pro displayed a significantly higher ability to activate the MDM2 promoter than P53-72Arg. Genotype analyses in 500 GCA patients and 1000 controls showed that significantly increased risk for developing GCA was associated with the MDM2 309G and the P53 72Pro allele compared with the MDM2 309T and the P53 72Arg allele in an allele dose-dependent manner. A joint effect between the MDM2 and P53 polymorphisms in intensifying GCA risk was detected, with the odds ratio (OR) for the presence of both MDM2 390GG and P53 72Pro/Pro genotypes being 5.05 [95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 2.50-10.20]. These results suggest that the P53 72Pro and MDM2 309G polymorphisms contribute to the risk of developing GCA.},

TS enhancer region, 3R G {\textgreater} C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), and TS 1494del6 polymorphisms were assessed in both fresh-frozen normal mucosa and tumor. Mutational analyses of TS and allelic imbalances were studied in all primary tumors and in 18 additional metachronic metastases. TS protein immunostaining was assessed in an expanded series of 214 tumors. Multivariate Cox models were adjusted for stage, differentiation, and location.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Tumor genotyping (frequency of allelic loss, 26{\%}) showed that the 3R/3R genotype was associated with a better outcome (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.38; 95{\%} CI, 0.16 to 0.93; P = .020 for the recessive model). 3R G {\textgreater} C SNP genotyping did not add prognostic information. Tumor TS 1494del6 allele (frequency of allelic loss, 36{\%}) was protective (for each allele with the deletion, based on an additive model, HR = 0.42; 95{\%} CI, 0.22 to 0.82; P = .0034). Both polymorphisms were in strong linkage disequilibrium (D' = 0.71, P {\textless} .001), and the 3R/-6 base pair (bp) haplotype showed a significant overall survival benefit compared with the most prevalent haplotype 2R/+6bp (HR = 0.42; 95{\%} CI, 0.20 to 0.85; P = .017). No TS point mutation was detected in primary tumors or metastases.

abstract = {Four popular somatic single nucleotide variant (SNV) calling methods (Varscan, SomaticSniper, Strelka and MuTect2) were carefully evaluated on the real whole exome sequencing (WES, depth of {\~{}}50X) and ultra-deep targeted sequencing (UDT-Seq, depth of {\~{}}370X) data. The four tools returned poor consensus on candidates (only 20{\%} of calls were with multiple hits by the callers). For both WES and UDT-Seq, MuTect2 and Strelka obtained the largest proportion of COSMIC entries as well as the lowest rate of dbSNP presence and high-alternative-alleles-in-control calls, demonstrating their superior sensitivity and accuracy. Combining different callers does increase reliability of candidates, but narrows the list down to very limited range of tumor read depth and variant allele frequency. Calling SNV on UDT-Seq data, which were of much higher read-depth, discovered additional true-positive variations, despite an even more tremendous growth in false positive predictions. Our findings not only provide valuable benchmark for state-of-the-art SNV calling methods, but also shed light on the access to more accurate SNV identification in the future.},

Individuals carrying 3 or more potential risk alleles had 1.78 times risk (95 {\%} CI: 1.13-2.80) to develop CRC compared with individuals without potential risk allele. This increased cancer risk was more pronounced in smokers who carried 3-4 potential risk alleles (OR = 2.75, 95 {\%} CI: 1.14-6.60) and in young subjects (OR = 2.05, 95 {\%} CI: 1.08-3.88).

abstract = {Next-generation sequencing has aided characterization of genomic variation. While whole-genome sequencing may capture all possible mutations, whole-exome sequencing remains cost-effective and captures most phenotype-altering mutations. Initial strategies for exome enrichment utilized a hybridization-based capture approach. Recently, amplicon-based methods were designed to simplify preparation and utilize smaller DNA inputs. We evaluated two hybridization capture-based and two amplicon-based whole-exome sequencing approaches, utilizing both Illumina and Ion Torrent sequencers, comparing on-target alignment, uniformity, and variant calling. While the amplicon methods had higher on-target rates, the hybridization capture-based approaches demonstrated better uniformity. All methods identified many of the same single-nucleotide variants, but each amplicon-based method missed variants detected by the other three methods and reported additional variants discordant with all three other technologies. Many of these potential false positives or negatives appear to result from limited coverage, low variant frequency, vicinity to read starts/ends, or the need for platform-specific variant calling algorithms. All methods demonstrated effective copy-number variant calling when evaluated against a single-nucleotide polymorphism array. This study illustrates some differences between whole-exome sequencing approaches, highlights the need for selecting appropriate variant calling based on capture method, and will aid laboratories in selecting their preferred approach.},

abstract = {Thymidine phosphorylase (TYMP), an enzyme involved in nucleotide synthesis, has been implicated in critical biological processes such as DNA replication, protection against mutations, and tissue repair. In this work, we retrospectively evaluated the influence of a polymorphism in the TYMP gene (rs112723255; G/A) upon the outcome of 448 patients subjected to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) from an human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling donor. The TYMP genotype of patients correlated with overall survival-carriers of the minor allele (A) being at an increased risk of dying after transplantation (hazard ratio, HR = 1.9; P = 0.004). This effect was mostly due to differences in transplant toxicity-related mortality (HR = 2.5; P = 0.029). In addition, the TYMP genotype of donors was associated with the risk of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-carriers of the minor allele being at an increased risk of developing this complication ([HR] = 1.7; P = 0.039). The impact of such polymorphism on the risk of chronic GVHD is limited to patients transplanted in early stage disease (HR = 2.2; P = 0.019). The combination of a donor harboring the minor allele with a patient homozygous for the major allele was associated with the highest risk of chronic GVHD (HR = 2.8; P = 0.008). These findings provide the first evidence of the significant impact of the TYMP genotype upon the clinical outcome of patients treated with HLA-identical sibling allo-SCT. Am. J.

Among them, TP53 is one of the major genetic risk factor which is known to be mutated in many of the breast tumor types. TP53 mutations in breast cancer are known to be related to a poor prognosis and chemo resistance. This renders them as a promising molecular target for the treatment of breast cancer. In this study, we present a computational based screening and molecular dynamic simulation of breast cancer associated deleterious non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms in TP53. We have predicted three deleterious coding non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms rs11540654 (R110P), rs17849781 (P278A) and rs28934874 (P151T) in TP53 with a phenotype in breast tumors using computational tools SIFT, Polyphen-2 and MutDB. We have performed molecular dynamics simulations to study the structural and dynamic effects of these TP53 mutations in comparison to the wild-type protein. Results from our simulations revealed a detailed consequence of the mutations on the p53 DNA-binding core domain that may provide insight for therapeutic approaches in breast cancer.},

To date, genetic polymorphisms of pyrimidine-synthesizing enzymes have been reported to be associated with the risk of malignant lymphoma or colon cancer. Accordingly, there may be associations between dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPYD) polymorphism and the risk of malignancies. We conducted a prevalent case-control study to investigate the associations between a functional polymorphism of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, DPYD T85C, and the risk of six malignancies. Controls were 445 Nagoya City inhabitants without a history of malignancy who had participated in a health check-up between August and September 2000. Case subjects were 901 patients with malignancies (99 esophageal, 131 gastric, 143 colon, 179 lung, 243 breast, and 106 malignant lymphomas) who had visited Aichi Cancer Center Hospital between March 1999 and December 2000. No DPYD CC individuals were found in either cases or controls. The frequency of DPYD TC genotype was 6.3{\%} in control subjects and 5.9{\%} in all case subjects (not significant). In a subgroup analysis, the frequency of TC genotype was highest in patients with gastric cancer (9.1{\%}), followed by those with lung cancer (8.3{\%}), with the lowest frequency in those with malignant lymphoma (1.9{\%}). The gender- and age- adjusted odds ratios and 95{\%} confidence intervals for the TC genotype of gastric cancer and malignant lymphoma were 1.52 (0.71-3.28) and 0.31 (0.71-1.34), respectively. Although prevalent cases were used, this study suggested that the influence of DPYD T85C posed only a limited risk for the six malignancies.},

Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) may play a central role in the action of 5-FU, an inhibitor of thymidylate synthase, by converting 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. The aim of this study was to ascertain whether two polymorphisms in the MTHFR gene (677C{\textgreater}T and 1298 A{\textgreater}C) could be used as genomic predictors of clinical response to fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy (in combination with irinotecan or oxaliplatin).

abstract = {PURPOSE: Severe toxicity is commonly observed in cancer patients receiving irinotecan. UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) catalyzes the glucuronidation of the active metabolite SN-38. This study prospectively evaluated the association between the prevalence of severe toxicity and UGT1A1 genetic variation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-six cancer patients with advanced disease refractory to other treatments received irinotecan 350 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks. Toxicity and pharmacokinetic data were measured during cycle 1. UGT1A1 variants (-3279G{\textgreater}T, -3156G{\textgreater}A, promoter TA indel, 211G{\textgreater}A, 686C{\textgreater}A) were genotyped. RESULTS: The prevalence of grade 4 neutropenia was 9.5{\%}. Grade 4 neutropenia was much more common in patients with the TA indel 7/7 genotype (3 of 6 patients; 50{\%}) compared with 6/7 (3 of 24 patients; 12.5{\%}) and 6/6 (0 of 29 patients; 0{\%}) (P =.001). The TA indel genotype was significantly associated with the absolute neutrophil count nadir (7/7 {\textless} 6/7 {\textless} 6/6, P =.02). The relative risk of grade 4 neutropenia was 9.3 (95{\%} CI, 2.4 to 36.4) for the 7/7 patients versus the rest of the patients. Pretreatment total bilirubin levels (mean +/- standard deviation) were significantly higher in patients with grade 4 neutropenia (0.83 +/- 0.08 mg/dL) compared to those without grade 4 neutropenia (0.47 +/- 0.03 mg/dL; P {\textless}.001). The -3156G{\textgreater}A variant seemed to distinguish different phenotypes of total bilirubin within the TA indel genotypes. The -3156 genotype and the SN-38 area under the concentration versus time curve were significant predictors of ln(absolute neutrophil count nadir; r(2) = 0.51). CONCLUSION: UGT1A1 genotype and total bilirubin levels are strongly associated with severe neutropenia, and could be used to identify cancer patients predisposed to the severe toxicity of irinotecan. The hypothesis that the -3156G{\textgreater}A variant is a better predictor of UGT1A1 status than the previously reported TA indel requires further testing.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is involved in the development and progression of lung cancer. Somatic EGFR mutations are predictors of response to treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitors (TKIs) for lung cancer, especially among never smokers. EGFR mutations may occur independently of other genetic alterations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The authors sequenced the EGFR-TK domain and the K-ras and p53 genes from lung tumor tissues from 44 never smokers and 46 smokers. A case-control study also was conducted to examine the relationship between an EGFR single nucleotide polymorphism in the TK domain and the lung cancer through a multivariate logistic regression analysis. In addition, the authors compared cell growth kinetics, EGFR-TKI sensitivity by MTT, and activation of signaling molecules by immunoblot in lung cancer cell lines with and without EGFR-TK mutations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: EGFR-TK mutations were more frequently observed in never smokers (25{\%}) than in smokers (2.2{\%}) (p = 0.001). Excluding cases with a K-ras mutation, the frequency of EGFR-TK domain mutation was still significantly higher in never smokers than in smokers, 26.2{\%} versus 4.5{\%} (p = 0.046). EGFR-TK mutations and K-ras mutations (p = 0.015), and p53 and K-ras mutations (p = 0.015) were mutually exclusive, but p53 and EGFR-TK mutations were not (p = 1.00). During sequencing of the EGFR-TK domain in tumors, an EGFR polymorphism (G2607A) was identified. The genotype AA and AA + AG occurred at a significantly higher frequency in lung cancer cases (n = 122) when compared with controls (n = 147) (odds ratio, 3.39 and 2.67; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.41-8.17 and 1.17-6.08, p = 0.006 and p = 0.02, respectively). This polymorphism was found independently of EGFR-TK mutations in lung cancer cases, indicating that it does not predispose to mutations. In vitro, lung cancer cell lines with EGFR-TK mutations also did not contain K-ras mutations and displayed a lower growth rate (50{\%}, p = 0.013) than EGFR-TK wild-type cell lines. EGFR-TK mutant cell lines were more sensitive to both gefitinib and erlotinib, although relative sensitivity to erlotinib compared with wild-type was less pronounced than for gefitinib. Cell lines with a lower growth rate also expressed higher levels of E-cadherin than faster growing cell lines.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: EGFR-TK mutation frequency is high in never-smoking lung cancer patients and is exclusive of mutation in K-ras but not p53. In addition to somatic EGFR-TK mutations that arise in lung tumors, germline variation in the EGFR-TK domain might also be associated with an increased risk of lung cancer. Somatic EGFR-TK mutations alter cell biology and response to EGFR-TKIs and may be mutation specific.},

abstract = {The potential clinical utility of genetic markers associated with response to fluoropyrimidine treatment in colorectal cancer patients remains controversial despite extensive study. Our aim was to test the clinical validity of both novel and previously identified markers of adverse events in a broad clinical setting. We have conducted an observational pharmacogenetic study of early adverse events in a cohort study of 254 colorectal cancer patients treated with 5-fluorouracil or capecitabine. Sixteen variants of nine key folate (pharmacodynamic) and drug metabolising (pharmacokinetic) enzymes have been analysed as individual markers and/or signatures of markers. We found a significant association between TYMP S471L (rs11479) and early dose modifications and/or severe adverse events (adjusted OR = 2.02 [1.03; 4.00], p = 0.042, adjusted OR = 2.70 [1.23; 5.92], p = 0.01 respectively). There was also a significant association between these phenotypes and a signature of DPYD mutations (Adjusted OR = 3.96 [1.17; 13.33], p = 0.03, adjusted OR = 6.76 [1.99; 22.96], p = 0.002 respectively). We did not identify any significant associations between the individual candidate pharmacodynamic markers and toxicity. If a predictive test for early adverse events analysed the TYMP and DPYD variants as a signature, the sensitivity would be 45.5 {\%}, with a positive predictive value of just 33.9 {\%} and thus poor clinical validity. Most studies to date have been under-powered to consider multiple pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variants simultaneously but this and similar individualised data sets could be pooled in meta-analyses to resolve uncertainties about the potential clinical utility of these markers.},

abstract = {Tissues used for clinical diagnostics are mostly formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) which provides many advantages. However, the quality of the obtained nucleic acids (NA) is reduced and this turns out to be a challenge for further molecular analyses. Although the spectrum of analyses of NA extracted from FFPE tissue has increased, the standard operating procedures for NA isolation from old tissue blocks still need to be improved. Here, we compared the efficiency of different NA extraction methods, using FFPE tissues of variable age and origin, with respect to downstream analyses. Our study showed that the phenol-chloroform isoamyl alcohol (PCI) and the commercial Qiagen protocol yielded samples with highest purity. The PCI protocol delivered the longest amplicons even from samples from the 1970s. We developed a short (1 h) tissue lysis procedure that turned out to be highly time- and cost-effective when DNA quality was tested using single and multiplex PCR. Compared to a 1-day lysis-protocol, the amplicons were only 100 bp shorter. In addition, single-copy genes used in daily routine were successfully amplified from long-term stored FFPE samples following 1-h tissue-lysis. The RNA integrity numbers (RIN) determined on RNA isolated from FFPE tissues indicated degraded RNA; however, all RINs were above the generally agreed threshold of 1.4. We showed that, depending on the purpose of the analysis, NA retrieved from FFPE tissues older than 40 years may be successfully used for molecular analysis.},

abstract = {A common arginine to proline polymorphism is harboured at codon 72 of the human p53 gene. In this investigation, we found that fibroblasts and lymphocytes isolated from arginine allele homozygote centenarians and sexagenarians (Arg+) undergo an oxidative-stress-induced apoptosis at a higher extent than cells obtained from proline allele carriers (Pro+). At variance, the difference in apoptosis susceptibility between Arg+ and Pro+ is not significant when cells from 30-year-old people are studied. Further, we found that Arg+ and Pro+ cells from centenarians differ in the constitutive levels of p53 protein and p53/MDM2 complex, as well as in the levels of oxidative stress-induced p53/Bcl-xL complex and mitochondria-localised p53. Consistently, all these differences are less evident in cells from 30-year-old people. Finally, we investigated the in vivo functional relevance of the p53 codon 72 genotype in a group of old patients (66-99 years of age) affected by acute myocardial ischaemia, a clinical condition in which in vivo cell death occurs. We found that Arg+ patients show increased levels of Troponin I and CK-MB, two serum markers that correlate with the extent of the ischaemic damage in comparison to Pro+ patients. In conclusion, these data suggest that p53 codon 72 polymorphism contributes to a genetically determined variability in apoptotic susceptibility among old people, which has a potentially relevant role in the context of an age-related pathologic condition, such as myocardial ischaemia.},

abstract = {This study aims at establishing relationships between genetic and non-genetic factors of variation of the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan and its metabolites; and also at establishing relationships between the pharmacokinetic or metabolic parameters and the efficacy and toxicity of irinotecan. We included 49 patients treated for metastatic colorectal cancer with a combination of 5-fluorouracil and irinotecan; a polymorphism in the UGT1A1 gene (TA repeat in the TATA box) and one in the CES2 gene promoter (830C{\textgreater}G) were studied as potential markers for SN-38 glucuronidation and irinotecan activation, respectively; and the potential activity of CYP3A4 was estimated from cortisol biotransformation into 6beta-hydroxycortisol. No pharmacokinetic parameter was directly predictive of clinical outcome or toxicity. The AUCs of three important metabolites of irinotecan, SN-38, SN-38 glucuronide and APC, were tentatively correlated with patients' pretreatment biological parameters related to drug metabolism (plasma creatinine, bilirubin and liver enzymes, and blood leukocytes). SN-38 AUC was significantly correlated with blood leukocytes number and SN-38G AUC was significantly correlated with plasma creatinine, whereas APC AUC was significantly correlated with plasma liver enzymes. The relative extent of irinotecan activation was inversely correlated with SN-38 glucuronidation. The TATA box polymorphism of UGT1A1 was significantly associated with plasma bilirubin levels and behaved as a significant predictor for neutropoenia. The level of cortisol 6beta-hydroxylation predicted for the occurrence of diarrhoea. All these observations may improve the routine use of irinotecan in colorectal cancer patients. UGT1A1 genotyping plus cortisol 6beta-hydroxylation determination could help to determine the optimal dose of irinotecan.},

In addition, T allele of TP: rs11479 was associated with higher TP expression in cancer tissues. We suggest TP: rs11479 variant combined with platelet counts may be useful prognostic makers in GIC patients receiving first-line FU chemotherapy and thrombopoietin factor should be used with caution in the rs11479 T allele bearing patients.},

abstract = {SN-38 is the active metabolite of irinotecan and it is metabolised through conjugation by uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase (UGT1A1). The major toxicity of irinotecan therapy is diarrhoea, which has been related to the enzymatic activity of UGT1A1. We examined the influence of the UGT1A1 gene promoter polymorphism in the toxicity profile, in the response rate and in the overall survival (OS) in 95 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with an irinotecan-containing chemotherapy. Genotypes were determined by analysing the sequence of TATA box of UGT1A1 of genomic DNA from the patients. Clinical parameters and genotypes were compared by univariate and multivariate statistical methods. The more frequent adverse effects were asthenia (34 patients), diarrhoea (29 patients) and neutropenia (20 patients). Severe diarrhoea was observed in 7/10 homozygous (70{\%}) and 15/45 heterozygous (33{\%}) in comparison to 7/40 (17{\%}) wild-type patients (P=0.005). These results maintained the statistical significance in logistic regression analysis (P=0.01) after adjustment for other clinical relevant variables. The presence of severe haematological toxicity increased from wild-type patients to UGT1A1(*)28 homozygotes, but without achieving statistical significance. No relationship was found between the UGT1A1(*)28 genotypes and infection, nausea or mucositis. In univariate studies, patients with the UGT1A1(*)28 polymorphism showed a trend to a poorer OS (P=0.09). In the multivariate analysis, the genotype was not related to clinical response or to OS. The role of the UGT1A1 genotype as a predictor of toxicity in cancer patients receiving irinotecan demands the performance of a randomized trial to ascertain whether genotype-adjusted dosages of the drug can help to establish safe and effective doses not only for patients with the UGT1A1(*)28 homozygous genotype but also for those with the most common UGT1A1 6/6 or 6/7 genotype.},

abstract = {Tumor analyses commonly employ a correction with a matched normal (MN), a sample from healthy tissue of the same individual, in order to distinguish germline mutations from somatic mutations. Since the majority of variants found in an individual are thought to be common within the population, we constructed a set of 931 samples from healthy, unrelated individuals, originating from two different sequencing platforms, to serve as a virtual normal (VN) in the absence of such an associated normal sample. Our approach removed (1) {\textgreater}96{\%} of the germline variants also removed by the MN sample and (2) a large number (2{\%}-8{\%}) of additional variants not corrected for by the associated normal. The combination of the VN with the MN improved the correction for polymorphisms significantly, with up to ∼30{\%} compared with MN and ∼15{\%} compared with VN only. We determined the number of unrelated genomes needed in order to correct at least as efficiently as the MN is about 200 for structural variations (SVs) and about 400 for single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and indels. In addition, we propose that the removal of common variants with purely position-based methods is inaccurate and incurs additional false-positive somatic variants, and more sophisticated algorithms, which are capable of leveraging information about the area surrounding variants, are needed for optimal accuracy. Our VN correction method can be used to analyze any list of variants, regardless of sequencing platform of origin. This VN methodology is available for use on our public Galaxy server.},

abstract = {Formalin fixing with paraffin embedding (FFPE) has been a standard sample preparation method for decades, and archival FFPE samples are still very useful resources. Nonetheless, the use of FFPE samples in cancer genome analysis using next-generation sequencing, which is a powerful technique for the identification of genomic alterations at the nucleotide level, has been challenging due to poor DNA quality and artificial sequence alterations. In this study, we performed whole-exome sequencing of matched frozen samples and FFPE samples of tissues from 4 cancer patients and compared the next-generation sequencing data obtained from these samples. The major differences between data obtained from the 2 types of sample were the shorter insert size and artificial base alterations in the FFPE samples. A high proportion of short inserts in the FFPE samples resulted in overlapping paired reads, which could lead to overestimation of certain variants; {\textgreater}20{\%} of the inserts in the FFPE samples were double sequenced. A large number of soft clipped reads was found in the sequencing data of the FFPE samples, and about 30{\%} of total bases were soft clipped. The artificial base alterations, C{\textgreater}T and G{\textgreater}A, were observed in FFPE samples only, and the alteration rate ranged from 200 to 1,200 per 1M bases when sequencing errors were removed. Although high-confidence mutation calls in the FFPE samples were compatible to that in the frozen samples, caution should be exercised in terms of the artifacts, especially for low-confidence calls. Despite the clearly observed artifacts, archival FFPE samples can be a good resource for discovery or validation of biomarkers in cancer research based on whole-exome sequencing.},

abstract = {Background and Objectives—As next generation sequencing (NGS) becomes a major sequencing platform in clinical diagnostic laboratories, it is critical to identify artifacts that constitute baseline noise and may interfere with detection of low level gene mutations. This is especially critical for applications requiring ultrasensitive detection, such as molecular relapse of solid tumors and early detection of cancer. We recently observed approximately {\~{}}10-fold higher C:G {\textgreater} T:A mutations than other background noise in both wild type peripheral blood and formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples. We hypothesized that these might represent cytosine deamination events that have been seen using other platforms. Methods—To test the hypothesis, we pretreated samples with uracil N-glycosylase (UNG). Additionally, we also tested whether some of the cytosine deamination might be laboratory artifact by simulating the heat associated with PCR thermocyling by subjecting samples to thermocycling in the absence of polymerase. To test the safety of universal UNG pretreatment, we tested known positive samples treated with UNG. Results—UNG pretreatment significantly reduced these mutations, consistent with a biologic source for the cytosine deamination. The simulated thermocycling heated samples demonstrated significantly increased C:G {\textgreater} T:A mutations without affecting other baseline base substitutions. Samples with known mutations demonstrated no decrease in our ability to detect these after treatment with UNG. Conclusions—Baseline noise during NGS is mostly due to cytosine deamination, the source of which is likely both biologic and an artifact of thermocycling, and it can be reduced by UNG pretreatment.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relationship between 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) pharmacokinetics and toxicity following i.v. bolus administration has not been extensively studied. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and eighty-one patients on adjuvant therapy with 5-FU plus leucovorin for colorectal cancer were the study population. 5-FU pharmacokinetics was determined on day 2 of the first, third, and fifth cycles; type and the grade of adverse reactions were recorded on the next cycle. RESULTS: The 5-FU area under the curve (AUC) measured at the first cycle ranged between 146 and 1236 mg x min/l and was significantly correlated with drug dose, patients' body weight (BW) and gender, females having higher AUCs. These covariates explained only 23{\%} of AUC variability. AUC and age were the only covariates which discriminated between toxic (grade {\textgreater} or =2) and nontoxic cycles (grade {\textless}2), with an optimal AUC cut-off value of 596 mg x min/l. Such a correlation was lost during the next cycles following dose reduction because of toxicity in 80 patients. CONCLUSIONS: A method for calculating the initial 5-FU dose is proposed which takes into account patient BW, gender and a target AUC of 596 mg x min/l. Nevertheless, it appears that a substantial part of 5-FU toxicity is not linked to pharmacokinetic factors and dose adjustments must still be on the basis of careful clinical surveillance.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND PCR amplicon sequencing has been widely used as a targeted approach for both DNA and RNA sequence analysis. High multiplex PCR has further enabled the enrichment of hundreds of amplicons in one simple reaction. At the same time, the performance of PCR amplicon sequencing can be negatively affected by issues such as high duplicate reads, polymerase artifacts and PCR amplification bias. Recently researchers have made some good progress in addressing these shortcomings by incorporating molecular barcodes into PCR primer design. So far, most work has been demonstrated using one to a few pairs of primers, which limits the size of the region one can analyze. RESULTS We developed a simple protocol, which enables the use of molecular barcodes in high multiplex PCR with hundreds of amplicons. Using this protocol and reference materials, we demonstrated the applications in accurate variant calling at very low fraction over a large region and in targeted RNA quantification. We also evaluated the protocol's utility in profiling FFPE samples. CONCLUSIONS We demonstrated the successful implementation of molecular barcodes in high multiplex PCR, with multiplex scale many times higher than earlier work. We showed that the new protocol combines the benefits of both high multiplex PCR and molecular barcodes, i.e. the analysis of a very large region, low DNA input requirement, very good reproducibility and the ability to detect as low as 1{\%} mutations with minimal false positives (FP).},

abstract = {Non-reproducible sequence artefacts are frequently detected in DNA from formalinfixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. However, no rational strategy has been developed for reduction of sequence artefacts from FFPE DNA as the underlying causes of the artefacts are poorly understood. As cytosine deamination to uracil is a common form of DNA damage in ancient DNA, we set out to examine whether treatment of FFPE DNA with uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) would lead to the reduction of C{\textgreater}T (and G{\textgreater}A) sequence artefacts. Heteroduplex formation in high resolution melting (HRM)-based assays was used for the detection of sequence variants in FFPE DNA samples. A set of samples that gave false positive HRM results for screening for the E17K mutation in exon 4 of the AKT1 gene were chosen for analysis. Sequencing of these samples showed multiple non-reproducible C:G{\textgreater}T:A artefacts. Treatment of the FFPE DNA with UDG prior to PCR amplification led to a very marked reduction of the sequence artefacts as indicated by both HRM and sequencing analysis, indicating that uracil lesions are the major cause of sequence artefacts. Similar results were shown for the BRAF V600 region in the same sample set and EGFR exon 19 in another sample set. UDG treatment specifically suppressed the formation of artefacts in FFPE DNA as it did not affect the detection of true KRAS codon 12 and true EGFR exon 19 and 20 mutations. We conclude that uracil in FFPE DNA leads to a significant proportion of sequence artefacts. These can be minimised by a simple UDG pretreatment which can be readily carried out, in the same tube, as the PCR immediately prior to commencing thermal cycling. HRM is a convenient way of monitoring both the degree of damage and the effectiveness of the UDG treatment. These findings have immediate and important implications for cancer diagnostics where FFPE DNA is used as the primary genetic material for mutational studies guiding personalised medicine strategies and where simple effective strategies to detect mutations are required.},

To this end, we studied 81 resected primary NSCLCs in order to detect p53 alterations. p53 protein accumulation was analysed using immunohistochemistry methods; p53 gene mutations in exons 5-9 were studied using polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism and sequencing techniques. p53 protein was immunodetected in 46.9{\%} of lung carcinomas and 44.7{\%} of p53-immunopositive tumours showed p53 mutations. Survival analysis was performed on 62 patients. No survival differences were found for patients with or without p53 immunopositivity. A shorter survival was found in patients with underlying p53 gene mutations, mainly in patients with squamous cell lung tumours; the worst prognosis was found when mutations were located in exon 5 (P = 0.007). In conclusion, the location of p53 mutations might be considered as a prognostic indicator for the evaluation of poor clinical evolution in NSCLC patients.},

Interindividual variability can result from genes involved in drug metabolism and transport, drug targets (receptors, enzymes, etc), and proteins relevant to cell survival (e.g., cell cycle, DNA repair, and apoptosis). The purpose of the current study is to establish a flexible, cost effective,high-throughput genotyping platform for candidate genes involved in chemo resistance and -sensitivity, and treatment outcomes. METHODS: We have adopted SNPlex for genotyping 432 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)in 160 candidate genes implicated in response to anticancer chemotherapy. RESULTS: The genotyping panels were applied to 39 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia undergoing flavopiridol chemotherapy, and 90 patients with colorectal cancer. 408 SNPs (94{\%})produced successful genotyping results. Additional genotyping methods were established for polymorphisms undetectable by SNPlex, including multiplexed SNaPshot for CYP2D6 SNPs, andPCR amplification with fluorescently labeled primers for the UGT1A1 promoter (TA)nTAA repeat polymorphism. CONCLUSION: This genotyping panel is useful for supporting clinical anticancer drug trials to identify polymorphisms that contribute to interindividual variability in drug response. Availability of population genetic data across multiple studies has the potential to yield genetic biomarkers for optimizing anticancer therapy.},

Somatic mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene and the activation of its downstream pathways predict the sensitivity to small-molecule inhibitors in non–small cell lung carcinoma. Therefore, we analyzed EGFR mutations and related pathways in gallbladder and bile duct carcinomas to consider the possible application of these alternative therapeutic strategies.$\backslash$nExperimental Design: Forty paraffin-embedded samples, including intrahepatic or extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder carcinoma, were studied after tumor cell isolation by laser microdissection and sequencing of EGFR tyrosine kinase domain (exons 18-21). Activation of EGFR pathway was studied by evaluating phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt.$\backslash$nResults: None of the 40 specimens had mutations in exon 18; one had one missense point mutation in exon 19, two in exon 20, and three in exon 21.

abstract = {About 40{\%} of French Canadian breast and/or ovarian cancer families harbor germline BRCA1 or BRCA1 mutations where common mutations account for about 84{\%} of all mutations identified in cancer families. Within a series of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative families, a germline TP53 13398 G{\textgreater}A (Arg213Gln) mutation was identified, which was selected for mutation analysis in this gene because of a family history consistent with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). Given the founder effects in this population, the 13398 G{\textgreater}A mutation was screened in series of 52 BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative cancer families, and a mutation-positive family was identified. However, pedigree inspection and expansion of mutation-positive families with the same mutation revealed that they were closely related to each other. To further characterize the contribution of TP53 in cancer families, mutation analysis was performed in the remaining BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative cancer families. Thirty sequence variants were identified, the majority of which occur in intronic sequences and are not predicted to affect the functionality of TP53. However, the 14538 G{\textgreater}A (Arg290His) mutation was identified in a family which did not exhibit features consistent with LFS or Li-Fraumeni-like (LFL) syndrome. Neither of the TP53 mutations was detected in 381 French Canadian women with breast cancer diagnosed before 50 years of age not selected for family history of cancer. In all, germline TP53 mutations were identified in two of 52 (3.8{\%}) cancer families, suggesting that TP53 is not a major contributor to BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative breast and/or ovarian cancer families of French Canadian descent.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) result in unbalanced STAT signaling and cause immune dysregulation and immunodeficiency. The latter is often characterized by the susceptibility to recurrent Candida infections, resulting in the clinical picture of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC). This study aims to assess the frequency of GOF STAT1 mutations in a large international cohort of CMC patients.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: STAT1 was sequenced in genomic DNA from 57 CMC patients and 35 healthy family members. The functional relevance of nine different STAT1 variants was shown by flow cytometric analysis of STAT1 phosphorylation in patients' peripheral blood cells (PBMC) after stimulation with interferon (IFN)-$\alpha$, IFN-$\gamma$ or interleukin-27 respectively. Extended clinical data sets were collected and summarized for 26 patients.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Heterozygous mutations within STAT1 were identified in 35 of 57 CMC patients (61 {\%}). Out of 39 familial cases from 11 families, 26 patients (67 {\%}) from 9 families and out of 18 sporadic cases, 9 patients (50 {\%}) were shown to have heterozygous mutations within STAT1. Thirteen distinct STAT1 mutations are reported in this paper. Eight of these mutations are known to cause CMC (p.M202V, p.A267V, p.R274W, p.R274Q, p.T385M, p.K388E, p.N397D, and p.F404Y). However, five STAT1 variants (p.F172L, p.Y287D, p.P293S, p.T385K and p.S466R) have not been reported before in CMC patients.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: STAT1 mutations are frequently observed in patients suffering from CMC. Thus, sequence analysis of STAT1 in CMC patients is advised. Measurement of IFN- or IL-induced STAT1 phosphorylation in PBMC provides a fast and reliable diagnostic tool and should be carried out in addition to genetic testing.},

abstract = {Deamination of nucleotides causes C:G{\textgreater}T:A changes in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples and produces false positives during next-generation sequencing (NGS). Uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) helps eliminate this issue, but the effect of UDG in different tissue preparation conditions has not been rigorously studied. To investigate whether UDG can reduce false-positive single-nucleotide variant (SNV) calls, we used tumor and normal tissues from gastric adenocarcinoma patients prepared using different fixation times and pH conditions. FFPE tumor blocks {\textgreater}10 years were also evaluated for the comparison. We performed semiconductor-based NGS to evaluate nucleotide changes and used UDG to test deamination-related effects. Sequencing quality parameters mildly worsened with prolonged fixation time, acidic pH, and delayed fixation. SNV calls and C:G{\textgreater}T:A changes increased after {\textgreater}48 hours of fixation. In both recently prepared and old FFPE tissue blocks, UDG treatment reduced deamination-induced nucleotide changes. In the recently prepared samples, both high-quality SNVs and mean target coverage were remarkably increased on treatment with UDG. However, the quality of NGS results from old-age samples varied irrespective of UDG treatment. In conclusion, based on our findings, we believe that when performing NGS on recently embedded blocks, it is important to consider that certain poorly fixed samples may be at the risk of being deaminated, which can be corrected with UDG treatment.},

abstract = {Li-Fraumeni syndrome, resulting from p53 (TP53) germline mutations, represents one of the most devastating genetic predispositions to cancer. Recently, the MDM2 SNP309 (T--{\textgreater}G variation) was shown to be associated with accelerated tumour formation in p53 mutation carriers. The impact of the common p53 codon 72 polymorphism on cancer risk remains controversial. We therefore investigated the effect of these two polymorphisms in 61 French carriers of the p53 germline mutation. The mean age of tumour onset in MDMD2 SNP309 G allele carriers (19.6 years) was significantly different from that observed in patients homozygous for the T allele (29.9 years, p{\textless}0.05). For the p53 codon 72 polymorphism, the mean age of tumour onset in Arg allele carriers (21.8 years) was also different from that of Pro/Pro patients (34.4 years, p{\textless}0.05). We observed a cumulative effect of both polymorphisms because the mean ages of tumour onset in carriers of the MDM2G and p53Arg alleles (16.9 years) and those with the MDM2T/T and p53Pro/Pro genotypes (43 years) were clearly different (p{\textless}0.02). Therefore, our results confirm the impact of the MDM2 SNP309 G allele on the age of tumour onset in germline p53 mutation carriers, and suggest that this effect may be amplified by the p53 72Arg allele. Polymorphisms affecting p53 degradation therefore represent one of the rare examples of modifier genetic factors identified to date in mendelian predispositions to cancer.},

As data in NSCLC are limited, we retrospectively ana- lyzed associations of p.Q787Q with clinicopathological parameters including clinical response and outcome in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) who received tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. Of 642 ADC patients whose tumors were profiled by next generation sequencing, 102 (15.9{\%}) carried EGFR mutations targetable by TKIs (30.4{\%} male patients, median age 65.1 y, 19.6{\%} smokers with 12.8 median pack years). Seventy-nine patients (77.5{\%}) received TKI therapy either as a first- or second-line therapy. Of the 102 EGFR-mutant tumors, 72 (70.6{\%}) exhibited the p.Q787Q polymorphism and another 12 (11.8{\%}) cases with p.Q787Q harbored an additional TKI insensitive mutation (p.T790M). The polymorphism was neither associated with classic clinicopathological parameters nor with overall survival (21.1 months vs. 20.1 months; P-value50.91) or clinical response (P-value50.122). The patients with p.T790M had worse survival compared to EGFR activating mutation carriers with and without p.Q787Q when analyzed as a separate group (27.5 months, P-value50.02). In conclusion, p.Q787Q is neither a suitable prognostic nor predictive biomarker for ADC patients receiving anti-EGFR therapy in first- or second-line of therapy.},

abstract = {Background: Individuals with Li-Fraumeni syndrome have a high lifetime risk of developing cancer. We assessed the feasibility and potential clinical effect of a comprehensive surveillance protocol in asymptomatic TP53 mutation carriers in families with this syndrome. Methods: We implemented a clinical surveillance protocol, using frequent biochemical and imaging studies, for asymptomatic TP53 mutation carriers on Jan 1, 2004, and did a prospective observational study of members of eight families with Li-Fraumeni syndrome who either chose to undergo surveillance or chose not to undergo surveillance. The primary outcome measure was detection of new cancers. The secondary outcome measure was overall survival. Findings: As of Nov 1, 2010, 33 TP53 mutation carriers were identified, 18 of whom underwent surveillance. The surveillance protocol detected ten asymptomatic tumours in seven patients, including small, high-grade tumours and low-grade or premalignant tumours. All seven mutation carriers were alive after a median follow-up of 24 months (IQR 22-65 months). 12 high-grade, high-stage tumours developed in 10 individuals in the non-surveillance group, two of whom (20{\%}) were alive at the end of follow-up (p=0{\textperiodcentered}0417 for comparison with survival in the surveillance group). 3-year overall survival was 100{\%} in the surveillance group and 21{\%} (95{\%} CI 4-48{\%}) in the non-surveillance group (p=0{\textperiodcentered}0155). Interpretation: Our findings show the feasibility of a clinical surveillance protocol for the detection of asymptomatic neoplasms in individuals with germline TP53 mutations. This strategy offers a management option for affected individuals, and its benefits lend support to the use of early genetic testing of at-risk individuals and families.

abstract = {The tumor suppressor gene TP53 and its negative regulator murine double minute 2 are involved in multiple cellular pathways. Two potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) MDM2 SNP309 and TP53 R72P have been extensively investigated to be associated with breast cancer risk. However, the original studies as well as the subsequent meta-analysis, have yielded contradictory results for the individual effect of the two SNPs on breast cancer risk, plus that conflicting results also existed for the combined effects of MDM2 SNP309 and TP53 R72P on breast cancer risk. This meta-analysis aimed to clarify the individual and combined effects of these two genes on breast cancer risk. We performed a meta-analysis of publications with a total 9,563 cases and 9,468 controls concerning MDM2 SNP309 polymorphism and 19,748 cases and 19,962 controls concerning TP53 R72P. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95 {\%} confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of the association. In overall meta-analysis, individuals with the MDM2 SNP309TG genotype were associated with a borderline higher breast cancer risk than those with TT genotype (OR = 1.11, 95 {\%} CI: 1.00-1.24, P (heterogeneity) = 0.007), whereas the TP53 R72P CC or GC genotype had no effects on breast cancer risk. In the stratified analyses, a significant association between MDM2 SNP309 and breast cancer risk were observed in Asian, but null significant association between TP53 R72P and breast cancer risk were found even in various subgroups. Moreover, no significant combined effects of MDM2 SNP309 and TP53 R72P were observed on breast cancer risk. The borderline association between MDM2 SNP309 and breast cancer risk in overall analysis should be treated with caution, and no significant combined effects for the two SNPs on breast cancer risk suggested functional investigations warranted to explore the molecular mechanism of the TP53-MDM2 circuit genes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS
The present study analyzed the relationship between TP53 codon 72 polymorphisms and the clinical outcome of advanced gastric cancer patients receiving capecitabine plus paclitaxel chemotherapy. 

METHODS
Three hundred patients with advanced gastric cancer treated with paclitaxel and capecitabine combination chemotherapy were enrolled in the present study. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes and determined using allele specific polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR). Correlation between TP53 codon 72 polymorphisms and treatment response, gastric cancer survival was analyzed. 

RESULTS
The Pro/Pro genotypes of TP53 codon 72 were significantly correlated with a lower response rate to capecitabine plus paclitaxel chemotherapy in patients with gastric cancer when compared to the Arg/Arg genotype (30.6 vs. 63.2{\%}, p value 0.000). Multivariate survival analysis also showed that the progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for patients with Pro/Pro genotypes of TP53 codon 72 were worse than for those with the Arg/Arg genotype (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.177, p = 0.009; HR = 2.145, p = 0.038, respectively). 

CONCLUSIONS
TP53 codon 72 polymorphisms was effective in predicting the response to chemotherapy and correlate with PFS and OS in patients with advanced gastric cancer treated with paclitaxel and capecitabine chemotherapy.},

abstract = {Paclitaxel plays a major role in the treatment of advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. However, there is no biomarker that could be used to predict the clinical response of paclitaxel. This work was conducted to investigate the association of genetic polymorphisms in FBW7 and its substrate genes and the clinical response of paclitaxel. Patients with advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma were treated with paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 over 3 hours day 1 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 day 1, every 3 weeks. The genotypes of 11 FBW7 and its substrate gene polymorphisms were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Statistical analysis revealed that patients with mTOR rs1057079 AG (ORadjusted: 4.59; 95{\%} CI: 1.78-11.86) genotype had significant correlation with the clinical response of paclitaxel when compared with AA genotype after adjustment for sex, age, and chemotherapy cycle. The median progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with advanced ESCC who received paclitaxel plus cisplatin (TP) as first-line treatment is 14.3 months (95{\%} CI: 9.0-19.60 months). The median PFS (mPFS) of AG genotypes and AA genotypes in mTOR rs1057079 were 17.31 months (95{\%} CI: 15.9-18.67 months) and 9.8 months (95{\%} CI: 8.58-11.02 months) (p=0.019), respectively.},

However, the great individual variability in both outcome and toxicity of platinum chemotherapy requires the identification of genetic markers that can be used to screen patients before treatment. In this study, 21 polymorphisms in 10 genes, the protein activities of which may be addressed in different aspects of cisplatind metabolism, were tested for correlations with efficacy and toxicity of cisplatin-cyclophosphamide regimen in 104 ovarian cancer patients. The glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) Ile105Val polymorphism was strongly associated with progression-free survival (chi(2)=12.12, P=0.002). The allelic status of the GSTA1 -69 C{\textgreater}T polymorphism correlated with the overall survival: patients with T/T genotype survived longer than C/C carriers (P=0.044). Thrombocytopenia, anemia and neuropathy were less frequent among patients with the GSTM1-null or GSTM3 intron 6 AGG/AGG genotypes. Severe neutropenia was associated with the TP53 72 Pro/Pro, XPD 312 Asp/Asn and XRCC1 399 Arg/Arg genotypes. A higher risk of nephrotoxicity was noted for patients with the heterozygous ERCC1 19007 T/C and 8092 C/A genotypes. No correlations were found between genotypes and complete tumor responses.},

To evaluate the importance of this specific type of inborn error of pyrimidine metabolism in the etiology of 5FU toxicity, an analysis of the DPD activity, the DPD gene, and the clinical presentation of patients suffering from severe toxicity after the administration of 5FU was performed. Our study demonstrated that in 59{\%} of the cases, a decreased DPD activity could be detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. It was observed that 55{\%} of patients with a decreased DPD activity suffered from grade IV neutropenia compared with 13{\%} of patients with a normal DPD activity (P = 0.01). Furthermore, the onset of toxicity occurred, on average, twice as fast in patients with low DPD activity as compared with patients with a normal DPD activity (10.0 +/- 7.6 versus 19.1 +/- 15.3 days; P {\textless} 0.05). Analysis of the DPD gene of 14 patients with a reduced DPD activity revealed the presence of mutations in 11 of 14 patients, with the splice site mutation IVS14+1G--{\textgreater}A being the most abundant one (6 of 14 patients; 43{\%}). Two novel missense mutations 496A--{\textgreater}G (M166V) and 2846A--{\textgreater}T (D949V) were detected in exon 6 and exon 22, respectively.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Next generation sequencing in cancer research may reveal germline variants of clinical significance. We report patient preferences for return of results and the prevalence of incidental pathogenic germline variants. PATIENTS AND METHODS Targeted exome sequencing of 202 genes was performed in 1000 advanced cancers using tumor and normal DNA in a research laboratory. Pathogenic variants in 18 genes, recommended for return by The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, as well as PALB2, were considered actionable. Patient preferences of return of incidental germline results were collected. Return of results was initiated with genetic counseling and repeat CLIA testing. RESULTS Of the 1000 patients who underwent sequencing, 43 had likely pathogenic germline variants: APC (1), BRCA1 (11), BRCA2 (10), TP53 (10), MSH2 (1), MSH6 (4), PALB2 (2), PTEN (2), TSC2 (1), and RB1 (1). 20 (47{\%}) of 43 variants were previously known based on clinical genetic testing. Of 1167 patients who consented for a germline testing protocol, 1157 (99{\%}) desired to be informed of incidental results. 23 previously unrecognized mutations identified in the research environment were confirmed with an orthogonal CLIA platform. All patients approached decided to proceed with formal genetic counseling; in all cases where formal genetic testing was performed the germline variant of concern validated with clinical genetic testing. CONCLUSIONS In this series 2.3{\%} patients had previously unrecognized pathogenic germline mutations in 19 cancer-related genes. Thus genomic sequencing must be accompanied by a plan for return of germline results, in partnership with genetic counseling.},

abstract = {Massively parallel sequencing approaches are beginning to be used clinically to characterize individual patient tu- mors and to select therapies based on the identified mutations. A major question in these analyses is the extent to which these methods identify clinically actionable alterations and whether the examination of the tumor tissue alone is sufficient or whether matched normal DNA should also be analyzed to accurately identify tumor-specific (somatic) alterations. To address these issues, we comprehensively evaluated 815 tumor-normal paired samples from patients of 15 tumor types. We identified genomic alterations using next-generation sequencing of whole exomes or 111 targeted genes that were validated with sensitivities {\textgreater}95{\%} and {\textgreater}99{\%}, respectively, and specificities {\textgreater}99.99{\%}. These analyses revealed an average of 140 and 4.3 somatic mutations per exome and targeted analysis, respectively. More than 75{\%} of cases had somatic alterations in genes associated with known therapies or current clinical trials. Analyses of matched normal DNA identified germline alterations in cancer-predisposing genes in 3{\%} of patients with apparently sporadic cancers. In contrast, a tumor-only sequencing approach could not definitively identify germline changes in cancer-predisposing genes and led to additional false-positive find- ings comprising 31{\%} and 65{\%} of alterations identified in targeted and exome analyses, respectively, including in potentially actionable genes. These data suggest that matched tumor-normal sequencing analyses are essential for precise identification and interpretation of somatic and germline alterations and have important implications for the diagnostic and therapeutic management of cancer patients.},

abstract = {Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) is the initial and rate-limiting enzyme of the uracil catabolic pathway, being critically important for inactivation of the commonly prescribed anti-cancer drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). DPD impairment leads to increased exposure to 5-FU and, in turn, increased anabolism of 5-FU to cytotoxic nucleotides, resulting in more severe clinical adverse effects. Numerous variants within the gene coding for DPD, DPYD, have been described, although only a few have been demonstrated to reduce DPD enzyme activity. To identify DPYD variants that alter enzyme function, we expressed 80 protein-coding variants in an isogenic mammalian system and measured their capacities to convert 5-FU to dihydro-fluorouracil, the product of DPD catabolism. The M166V, E828K, K861R, and P1023T variants exhibited significantly higher enzyme activity than wild-type DPD (120{\%}, P = 0.025; 116{\%}, P = 0.049; 130{\%}, P = 0.0077; 138{\%}, P = 0.048, respectively). Consistent with clinical association studies of 5-FU toxicity, the D949V substitution reduced enzyme activity by 41{\%} (P = 0.0031). Enzyme activity was also significantly reduced for 30 additional variants, 19 of which had {\textless}25{\%} activity. None of those 30 variants have been previously reported to associate with 5-FU toxicity in clinical association studies, which have been conducted primarily in populations of European ancestry. Using publicly available genotype databases, we confirmed the rarity of these variants in European populations but showed that they are detected at appreciable frequencies in other populations. These data strongly suggest that testing for the reported deficient DPYD variations could dramatically improve predictive genetic tests for 5-FU sensitivity, especially in individuals of non-European descent.},

RESULTS: The response rate was significantly higher in patients with TS 3R/3R or MTHFR 677 TT gene polymorphism compared with the other groups. The difference of response rate translated to a difference in time to progression. Similar results were observed in the retrospective analysis and the prospective confirmatory trial. CONCLUSION: The analysis of gene polymorphism allows delineation of a group of patients (30{\%}) with a response rate to a single drug of approximately 50{\%}.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s).Background: Detection of DNA mutations at very low allele fractions with high accuracy will significantly improve the effectiveness of precision medicine for cancer patients. To achieve this goal through next generation sequencing, researchers need a detection method that 1) captures rare mutation-containing DNA fragments efficiently in the mix of abundant wild-type DNA; 2) sequences the DNA library extensively to deep coverage; and 3) distinguishes low level true variants from amplification and sequencing errors with high accuracy. Targeted enrichment using PCR primers provides researchers with a convenient way to achieve deep sequencing for a small, yet most relevant region using benchtop sequencers. Molecular barcoding (or indexing) provides a unique solution for reducing sequencing artifacts analytically. Although different molecular barcoding schemes have been reported in recent literature, most variant calling has been done on limited targets, using simple custom scripts. The analytical performance of barcode-aware variant calling can be significantly improved by incorporating advanced statistical models. Results: We present here a highly efficient, simple and scalable enrichment protocol that integrates molecular barcodes in multiplex PCR amplification. In addition, we developed smCounter, an open source, generic, barcode-aware variant caller based on a Bayesian probabilistic model. smCounter was optimized and benchmarked on two independent read sets with SNVs and indels at 5 and 1{\%} allele fractions. Variants were called with very good sensitivity and specificity within coding regions. Conclusions: We demonstrated that we can accurately detect somatic mutations with allele fractions as low as 1{\%} in coding regions using our enrichment protocol and variant caller.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: An increasing number of studies show that genetic markers can aid in refining prognostic information and predicting the benefit from systemic therapy. Our goal was to develop a high throughput, cost-effective and simple methodology for the detection of clinically relevant hot spot mutations in colon cancer. METHODS: The Maldi-Tof mass spectrometry platform and OncoCarta panel from Sequenom were used to profile 239 colon cancers and 39 metastatic lymph nodes from NSABP clinical trial C-07 utilizing routinely processed FFPET (formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue). RESULTS: Among the 238 common hot-spot cancer mutations in 19 genes interrogated by the OncoCarta panel, mutations were detected in 7 different genes at 26 different nucleotide positions in our colon cancer samples. Twenty-four assays that detected mutations in more than 1{\%} of the samples were reconfigured into a new multiplexed panel, termed here as ColoCarta. Mutation profiling was repeated on 32 mutant samples using ColoCarta and the results were identical to results with OncoCarta, demonstrating that this methodology was reproducible. Further evidence demonstrating the validity of the data was the fact that the mutation frequencies of the most common colon cancer mutations were similar to the COSMIC (Catalog of Somatic Mutations in Cancer) database. The frequencies were 43.5{\%} for KRAS, 20.1{\%} for PIK3CA, and 12.1{\%} for BRAF. In addition, infrequent mutations in NRAS, AKT1, ABL1, and MET were detected. Mutation profiling of metastatic lymph nodes and their corresponding primary tumors showed that they were 89.7{\%} concordant. All mutations found in the lymph nodes were also found in the corresponding primary tumors, but in 4 cases a mutation was present in the primary tumor only. CONCLUSIONS: This study describes a high throughput technology that can be used to interrogate DNAs isolated from routinely processed FFPET and identifies the specific mutations that are common to colon cancer. The development of this technology and the ColoCarta panel may provide a mechanism for rapid screening of mutations in clinically relevant genes like KRAS, PIK3CA, and BRAF.

Ten cases with {\textless} 10{\%} serous histology were also assessed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Seven subjects (4.6{\%}) carried germline loss-of-function mutations: 3 subjects (2.0{\%}) with mutations in BRCA1, 2 subjects (1.3{\%}) with mutations in TP53, and 2 subjects (1.3{\%}) with mutations in CHEK2 (checkpoint kinase 2). One subject with {\textless} 10{\%} serous histology had an MSH6 mutation.

Mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes that cause Lynch syndrome are rare in USC. The germline BRCA1 mutation rate in USC subjects of 2{\%} is higher than expected in a nonfounder population, suggesting that USC is associated with hereditary breast and ovarian carcinoma in a small proportion of cases.

Peripheral blood samples from 146 prospectively enrolled patients were used for genotyping polymorphisms in thymidylate synthase (TS), methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), excision repair cross-complementation group-1 (ERCC 1) xeroderma pigmentosum group-D (XPD), X-ray cross-complementing-1 (XRCC 1), X-ray cross-complementing-3 (XRCC 3) and uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferases-A1 (UGT1 A1). TS 3'-UTR 6+/6+ and XRCC3-241 C/C genotypes were associated with adverse PFS. Hazard ratio for PFS achieved 2.89 (95{\%} confidence interval=1.56-5.80; P=0.002) in 30 patients (20{\%}) with both risk genotypes. Risk for Grade III-IV neutropenia was significantly associated with UGT1A1*28 7/7 genotype. These promising findings deserve further investigations and their validation in independent prospective studies.},

abstract = {Frozen biospecimens are crucial for translational research and contain well-preserved nucleic acids and protein. However, the risks of freezer failure as well as space, cost, and environmental concerns of frozen biospecimens are substantial. Objective: The purpose of the study was to review the current status of room temperature biospecimen storage. Methods: We searched Pubmed and vendor websites to identify relevant information. Results: Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues have great value but their use is limited by cross-linking and fragmentation of nucleic acids, as well as loss of enzymatic activity. Stabilization solutions can now robustly preserve fresh tissue for up to 7. days at room temperature. For longer term storage, commercial vendors of chemical matrices claim real time stability of nucleic acids of over 2 years and their accelerated aging studies to date suggest stability for 12. years for RNA and 60. years for DNA. However, anatomic pathology biorepositories store mostly frozen tissue rather than nucleic acids. Small quantities of tissue can be directly placed on some chemical matrices to stabilize DNA, however RNA and proteins are not preserved. Current lyophilization approaches can preserve histomorphology, DNA, RNA, and proteins though RNA shows moderate degradation after 1-2. years. Formalin-free fixatives show improved but varying abilities to preserve nucleic acids and face validation as well as cost barriers in replacing FFPE specimens. The paraffin embedding process can degrade RNA. Conclusion: Development of robust long-term room temperature biospecimen tissue storage technology can potentially reduce costs for the biomedical community in the face of growing targeted therapy needs and decreasing budgets. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.},

abstract = {Irinotecan and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) are used to treat metastatic colorectal cancer. Irinotecan's active metabolite is inactivated by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1), which is deficient in Gilbert's syndrome. Irinotecan and metabolites are transported by P-glycoprotein, encoded by ABCB1. 5-FU targets folate metabolism through inhibition of thymidylate synthase (TYMS). Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) generates active folate necessary for haematopoiesis. We retrospectively genotyped 140 Swedish and Norwegian irinotecan and 5-FU-treated colorectal cancer patients from the Nordic VI clinical trial for selected variants of UGT1A1, ABCB1, TYMS and MTHFR. We found an increased risk of clinically relevant early toxicity in patients carrying the ABCB1 3435 T/T genotype, Odds ratio (OR)=3.79 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI)=1.09-13.2), and in patients carrying the UGT1A1(*)28/(*)28 genotype, OR=4.43 (95{\%} CI=1.30-15.2). Patients with UGT1A1(*)28/(*)28 had an especially high risk of neutropenia, OR=6.87 (95{\%} CI=1.70-27.7). Patients who had reacted with toxicity during the first two cycles were in total treated with fewer cycles (P{\textless}0.001), and less often responded to treatment (P{\textless}0.001). Genetic variation in ABCB1 was associated with both early toxicity and lower response to treatment. Carriers of the ABCB1 1236T-2677T-3435T haplotype responded to treatment less frequently (43 vs 67{\%}, P=0.027), and survived shorter time, OR=1.56 (95{\%} CI=1.01-2.45).},

abstract = {Protein p53 is the tumor suppressor involved in cell cycle control and apoptosis. There are several polymorphisms reported for p53 which can affect important regions involved in protein tumor suppressor activity. Amongst the polymorphisms described, R213R and 13949 g→a are rarely studied, with an estimate frequency not yet available for the Brazilian population. The purpose of this study was to investigate the genotype and allele frequencies and associations of these polymorphisms in a group of patients with altered esophageal tissue from South Brazil and compare with the frequency observed for a control population. A total of 35 patients for R213R and 45 for 13494 g→a polymorphisms analysis with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms diagnosed by upper digestive endoscopy and confirmed by biopsy were studied. For both groups, 100 controls were used for comparison. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was also analyzed for a selected group of patients where normal and affected tissue was available. There was one patient with Barrett's Esophagus (BE) showing LOH for R213R out of two heterozygous samples analyzed and two patients (esophagitis and BE) for 13494 g→a polymorphism. We also aimed to build a haplotype for both polymorphisms collectively analyzed with R27P polymorphism, previously reported by our group. There were no significant differences in allele and genotype distribution between patients and controls. Although using esophagitis, intestinal metaplasia of the cardia and BE samples, all non-neoplastic lesions, we can conclude that these sites do not represent genetic susceptibility markers for the development and early progression of GERD to BE and esophageal cancer. Additional studies are required in order to investigate other determiners of early premalignant lesions known to predispose to esophageal cancer.},

Of the patients polymorphic for DPYD IVS14+1G{\textgreater}A, 2846A{\textgreater}T, and 1236G{\textgreater}A, 71{\%} (5 of 7), 63{\%} (5 of 8), and 50{\%} (14 of 28) developed grade 3 to 4 diarrhea, respectively, compared with 24{\%} in the overall population. All patients polymorphic for IVS14+1G{\textgreater}A developed any grade 3 to 4 toxicity, including one possibly capecitabine-related death. Because of toxicity, a mean capecitabine dose reduction of 50{\%} was applied in IVS14+1G{\textgreater}A and 25{\%} in 2846A{\textgreater}T variant allele carriers. Patients were categorized into six haplotype groups: one predicted for reduced (10{\%}), and two for increased risks (41{\%} and 33{\%}) for severe diarrhea.

abstract = {In clinical exome and genome sequencing, there is a potential for the recognition and reporting of incidental or secondary findings unrelated to the indication for ordering the sequencing but of medical value for patient care. The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) recently published a policy statement on clinical sequencing that emphasized the importance of alerting the patient to the possibility of such results in pretest patient discussions, clinical testing, and reporting of results. The ACMG appointed a Working Group on Incidental Findings in Clinical Exome and Genome Sequencing to make recommendations about responsible management of incidental findings when patients undergo exome or genome sequencing. This Working Group conducted a year-long consensus process, including an open forum at the 2012 Annual Meeting and review by outside experts, and produced recommendations that have been approved by the ACMG Board. Specific and detailed recommendations, and the background and rationale for these recommendations, are described herein. The ACMG recommends that laboratories performing clinical sequencing seek and report mutations of the specified classes or types in the genes listed here. This evaluation and reporting should be performed for all clinical germline (constitutional) exome and genome sequencing, including the "normal" of tumor-normal subtractive analyses in all subjects, irrespective of age but excluding fetal samples. We recognize that there are insufficient data on penetrance and clinical utility to fully support these recommendations, and we encourage the creation of an ongoing process for updating these recommendations at least annually as further data are collected.},

abstract = {Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has emerged as a powerful technique for the detection of genetic variants in the clinical laboratory. NGS can be performed using DNA from FFPE tissue, but it is unknown whether such specimens are truly equivalent to unfixed tissue for NGS applications. To address this question, we performed hybridization-capture enrichment and multiplexed Illumina NGS for 27 cancer-related genes using DNA from 16 paired fresh-frozen and routine FFPE lung adenocarcinoma specimens and conducted extensive comparisons between the sequence data from each sample type. This analysis revealed small but detectable differences between FFPE and frozen samples. Compared with frozen samples, NGS data from FFPE samples had smaller library insert sizes, greater coverage variability, and an increase in C to T transitions that was most pronounced at CpG dinucleotides, suggesting interplay between DNA methylation and formalin-induced changes; however, the error rate, library complexity, enrichment performance, and coverage statistics were not significantly different. Comparison of base calls between paired samples demonstrated concordances of {\textgreater}99.99{\%}, with 96.8{\%} agreement in the single-nucleotide variants detected and {\textgreater}98{\%} accuracy of NGS data when compared with genotypes from an orthogonal single-nucleotide polymorphism array platform. This study demonstrates that routine processing of FFPE samples has a detectable but negligible effect on NGS data and that these samples can be a reliable substrate for clinical NGS testing. ?? 2013 American Society for Investigative Pathology and the Association for Molecular Pathology.

The crystal structure of the homodimeric pig liver enzyme (2x 111 kDa) determined at 1.9 A resolution reveals a highly modular subunit organization, consisting of five domains with different folds. Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase contains two FAD, two FMN and eight [4Fe-4S] clusters, arranged in two electron transfer chains that pass the dimer interface twice. Two of the Fe-S clusters show a hitherto unobserved coordination involving a glutamine residue. The ternary complex of an inactive mutant of the enzyme with bound NADPH and 5-fluorouracil reveals the architecture of the substrate-binding sites and residues responsible for recognition and binding of the drug.},

The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence of genetic variants in these receptors and its potential clinical implications in colorectal cancer (CRC).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: VEGFR2, PDGFR$\alpha$ and PDGFR$\beta$ mutations were evaluated by sequencing their tyrosine kinase domains in 8 CRC cell lines and in 92 samples of patients with CRC. Correlations with clinicopathological features and survival were analyzed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Four SNPs were identified, three in PDGFR$\alpha$ [exon 12 (A12): c.1701A{\textgreater}G; exon 13 (A13): c.1809G{\textgreater}A; and exon 17 (A17): c.2439+58C{\textgreater}A] and one in PDGFR$\beta$ [exon 19 (B19): c.2601A{\textgreater}G]. SNP B19, identified in 58{\%} of tumor samples and in 4 cell lines (LS174T, LS180, SW48, COLO205), was associated with higher PDGFR and pPDGFR protein levels. Consistent with this observation, 5-year survival was greater for patients with PDGFR B19 wild type tumors (AA) than for those harboring the G-allele genotype (GA or GG) (51{\%} vs 17{\%}; p=0.073). Multivariate analysis confirmed SNP B19 (p=0.029) was a significant prognostic factor for survival, independent of age (p=0.060) or TNM stage (p{\textless}0.001).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: PDGFR$\beta$ exon 19 c.2601A{\textgreater}G SNP is commonly encountered in CRC patients and is associated with increased pathway activation and poorer survival. Implications regarding its potential influence in response to PDGFR-targeted agents remain to be elucidated.},

Bottlenecking can result from too few input genomes. By using 16 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) cancer-free specimens and 118 cancer specimens with known mutation status, we validated the six traditional analytic performance characteristics recommended by the Next-Generation Sequencing: Standardization of Clinical Testing Working Group.

Their individual associations, however, in 5-FU-based combination therapies, remain controversial and require further systematic study in a large patient population receiving comparable treatment regimens with uniform clinical data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We genotyped 2886 stage III colon cancer patients treated adjuvantly in a randomized phase III trial with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI, alone or combined with cetuximab, and tested the individual associations between functionally deleterious DPYD variants and toxicity. Logistic regressions were used to assess univariate and multivariable associations. All statistical tests were two-sided.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In 2594 patients with complete adverse event (AE) data, the incidence of grade 3 or greater 5FU-AEs in DPYD*2A, I560S, and D949V carriers were 22/25 (88.0{\%}), 2/4 (50.0{\%}), and 22/27 (81.5{\%}), respectively. Statistically significant associations were identified between grade 3 or greater 5FU-AEs and both DPYD*2A (odds ratio [OR] = 15.21, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 4.54 to 50.96, P {\textless} .001) and D949V (OR = 9.10, 95{\%} CI = 3.43 to 24.10, P {\textless} .001) variants. Statistical significance remained after adjusting for multiple variables. The DPYD*2A variant statistically significantly associated with the specific AEs nausea/vomiting (P = .007) and neutropenia (P {\textless} .001), whereas D949V statistically significantly associated with dehydration (P = .02), diarrhea (P = .003), leukopenia (P = .002), neutropenia (P {\textless} .001), and thrombocytopenia (P {\textless} .001). Although two patients with I560S had grade≥3 5FU-AEs; a statistically significant association could not be demonstrated because of its low frequency (P = .48).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: In the largest study to date, statistically significant associations were found between DPYD variants (DPYD*2A and D949V) and increased incidence of grade 3 or greater 5FU-AEs in patients treated with adjuvant 5-FU-based combination chemotherapy.},

abstract = {Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE) is an autosomal recessive disorder defined clinically by severe gastrointestinal dysmotility; cachexia; ptosis, ophthalmoparesis, or both; peripheral neuropathy; leukoencephalopathy; and mitochondrial abnormalities. The disease is caused by mutations in the thymidine phosphorylase (TP) gene. TP protein catalyzes phosphorolysis of thymidine to thymine and deoxyribose 1-phosphate. We identified 21 probands (35 patients) who fulfilled our clinical criteria for MNGIE. MNGIE has clinically homogeneous features but varies in age at onset and rate of progression. Gastrointestinal dysmotility is the most prominent manifestation, with recurrent diarrhea, borborygmi, and intestinal pseudo-obstruction. Patients usually die in early adulthood (mean, 37.6 years; range, 26-58 years). Cerebral leukodystrophy is characteristic. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has depletion, multiple deletions, or both. We have identified 16 TP mutations. Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations were present in all patients tested. Leukocyte TP activity was reduced drastically in all patients tested, 0.009 +/- 0.021 micromol/hr/mg (mean +/- SD; n = 16), compared with controls, 0.67 +/- 0.21 micromol/hr/mg (n = 19). MNGIE is a recognizable clinical syndrome caused by mutations in thymidine phosphorylase. Severe reduction of TP activity in leukocytes is diagnostic. Altered mitochondrial nucleoside and nucleotide pools may impair mtDNA replication, repair, or both.},

abstract = {CONTEXT Formalin fixation and paraffin embedding is a timeless, cost-efficient, and widely adopted method of preserving human tissue biospecimens that has resulted in a substantial reservoir of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded blocks that represent both the pathology and preanalytical handling of the biospecimen. This reservoir of specimens is increasingly being used for DNA, RNA, and proteomic analyses. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the impact of preanalytical factors associated with the formalin fixation and paraffin embedding process on downstream morphological and molecular endpoints. DATA SOURCES We surveyed the existing literature using the National Cancer Institute's Biospecimen Research Database for published reports investigating the potential influence of preanalytical factors associated with the formalin fixation and paraffin embedding process on DNA, RNA, protein, and morphological endpoints. CONCLUSIONS Based on the literature evidence, the molecular, proteomic, and morphological endpoints can be altered in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens by suboptimal processing conditions. While the direction and magnitude of effects associated with a given preanalytical factor were dependent on the analyte (DNA, RNA, protein, and morphology) and analytical platform, acceptable conditions are highlighted, and a summary of conditions that could preclude analysis is provided.},

Affected families tend to develop bone and soft tissue sarcomas, breast cancers, brain tumors, leukemias, and adrenocortical carcinomas. In some kindreds, the genetic abnormality associated with this cancer phenotype is a heterozygous germline mutation in the p53 tumor suppressor gene. Recently, we identified one patient who presented in early childhood with multiple primary cancers and who harbored three germline p53 alterations (R156H and R267Q on the maternal allele and R290H on the paternal allele). To classify the biologic effects of these alterations, functional properties of each of the p53 mutants were examined using in vitro assays of cellular growth suppression and transcriptional activation. Each amino acid substitution conferred partial or complete loss of wild-type p53 function, but the child completed normal embryonic development. This observation has not been previously reported in a human, but is consistent with observations of normal embryogenesis in p53-deficient mice.},

abstract = {Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) is the initial and rate-limiting enzyme in the catabolism of the pyrimidine bases uracil, thymine and the antineoplastic agent 5-fluorouracil. Genetic variations in the gene encoding DPD (DPYD) have emerged as predictive risk alleles for 5FU-associated toxicity. Here we report an in-depth analysis of genetic variants in DPYD and their consequences for DPD activity and pyrimidine metabolites in 100 Dutch healthy volunteers. 34 SNPs were detected in DPYD and 15 SNPs were associated with altered plasma concentrations of pyrimidine metabolites. DPD activity was significantly associated with the plasma concentrations of uracil, the presence of a specific DPYD mutation (c.1905. +. 1G. {\textgreater}. A) and the combined presence of three risk variants in DPYD (c.1905. +. 1G. {\textgreater}. A, c.1129-5923C. {\textgreater}. G, c.2846A. {\textgreater}. T), but not with an altered uracil/dihydrouracil (U/UH2) ratio. Various haplotypes were associated with different DPD activities (haplotype D3, a decreased DPD activity; haplotype F2, an increased DPD activity). Functional analysis of eight recombinant mutant DPD enzymes showed a reduced DPD activity, ranging from 35{\%} to 84{\%} of the wild-type enzyme. Analysis of a DPD homology model indicated that the structural effect of the novel p.G401R mutation is most likely minor. The clinical relevance of the p.D949V mutation was demonstrated in a cancer patient heterozygous for the c.2846A. {\textgreater}. T mutation and a novel nonsense mutation c.1681C. {\textgreater}.

abstract = {PURPOSE: UGT1A1*28 polymorphism has been associated with decreased glucuronidation of SN38, the active metabolite of irinotecan. This could increase toxicity with this agent. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a prospective study, 250 metastatic colorectal cancer patients were treated with irinotecan, fluorouracil, and leucovorin as first-line treatment. UGT1A1*28 polymorphism was investigated with respect to the distribution of hematologic and nonhematologic toxicity, objective response rate, and survival. Pharmacokinetics was investigated in a subgroup of patients (71 of 250) who had been analyzed with respect to toxicity and efficacy. RESULTS: UGT1A1*28 polymorphism was associated with a higher risk of grade 3 to 4 hematologic toxicity (odds ratio [OR], 8.63; 95{\%} CI, 1.31 to 56.55), which was only relevant for the first cycle, and was not seen throughout the whole treatment period for patients with both variant alleles TA7/TA7 compared with wild-type TA6/TA6. The response rate was also higher in TA7/TA7 patients (OR, 0.32; 95{\%} CI, 0.12 to 0.86) compared with TA6/TA6. A nonsignificant survival advantage was observed for TA7/TA7 when compared with TA6/TA6 patients (hazard ratio, 0.81; 95{\%} CI, 0.45 to 1.44). Higher response rates were explained by a different pharmacokinetics with higher biliary index [irinotecan area under the curve (AUC)x(SN38 AUC/SN38G AUC)] and lower glucuronidation ratio (SN38G AUC/SN38 AUC) associated with the TA7/TA7 genotype and a higher response rate, indicating that the polymorphism is functionally relevant. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that UGT1A1*28 polymorphism is of some relevance to toxicity; however, it is less important than discussed in previous smaller trials. In particular, the possibility of a dose reduction for irinotecan in patients with a UGT1A1*28 polymorphism is not supported by the result of this analysis.},

abstract = {Glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) participates in detoxification of potentially genotoxic compounds that may alter the efficacy and toxicity of platinum-based chemotherapy. We analyzed the influence of I105V polymorphism of GSTP1 on clinico-pathological features and outcomes in 166 Chinese patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma who had been treated with first-line FOLFOX-4. Combined analysis of GSTP1 I105V, ERCC1-118, and XPD-751 polymorphisms was also conducted. The results showed that, in comparison with Caucasian populations, a remarkably lower prevalence of Val105 allele variants was noted (24.7{\%}). Patients with Val105 allele variants had a higher response to FOLFOX-4 (56.1{\%}vs 37.6{\%}, P = 0.04), and a longer progression-free (P {\textless} 0.01) as well as overall (P {\textless} 0.01) survival. By adjusted analysis, this polymorphism was identified as an independent prognostic factor (P = 0.01). In combined analysis, patients without any risk genotype, including GSTP1-105 Ile/Ile, ERCC1-118 C/T or T/T, and XPD-751 Lys/Gln, had significantly longer progression-free and overall survivals (P {\textless} 0.01). In addition, patients with Val105 allele variants had a higher incidence of grade 3/4 cumulative neuropathy after different cycles of treatment. These data suggest that Asian populations have a lower prevalence of I105V polymorphism in GSTP1. I105V polymorphism in GSTP1, by reducing its enzymatic activity and consequential detoxification to oxaliplatin, could be a key determinant for a better outcome, but more neurotoxicity, to FOLFOX-4 treatment.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Assessment of DNA integrity and quantity remains a bottleneck for high-throughput molecular genotyping technologies, including next-generation sequencing. In particular, DNA extracted from paraffin-embedded tissues, a major potential source of tumor DNA, varies widely in quality, leading to unpredictable sequencing data. We describe a picoliter droplet-based digital PCR method that enables simultaneous detection of DNA integrity and the quantity of amplifiable DNA.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Using a multiplex assay, we detected 4 different target lengths (78, 159, 197, and 550 bp). Assays were validated with human genomic DNA fragmented to sizes of 170 bp to 3000 bp. The technique was validated with DNA quantities as low as 1 ng. We evaluated 12 DNA samples extracted from paraffin-embedded lung adenocarcinoma tissues.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: One sample contained no amplifiable DNA. The fractions of amplifiable DNA for the 11 other samples were between 0.05{\%} and 10.1{\%} for 78-bp fragments and ≤1{\%} for longer fragments. Four samples were chosen for enrichment and next-generation sequencing. The quality of the sequencing data was in agreement with the results of the DNA-integrity test. Specifically, DNA with low integrity yielded sequencing results with lower levels of coverage and uniformity and had higher levels of false-positive variants.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The development of DNA-quality assays will enable researchers to downselect samples or process more DNA to achieve reliable genome sequencing with the highest possible efficiency of cost and effort, as well as minimize the waste of precious samples.},

abstract = {The aim of the study was to investigate the associations between UGT1A1(*)28 genotype and (1) response rates, (2) febrile neutropenia and (3) dose intensity in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with irinotecan. UGT1A1(*)28 genotype was determined in 218 patients receiving irinotecan (either first-line therapy with capecitabine or second-line as monotherapy) for metastatic colorectal cancer. TA(7) homozygotes receiving irinotecan combination therapy had a higher incidence of febrile neutropenia (18.2{\%}) compared to the other genotypes (TA(6)/TA(6) : 1.5{\%}; TA(6)/TA(7) : 6.5{\%}, P=0.031). TA(7) heterozygotes receiving irinotecan monotherapy also suffered more febrile neutropenia (19.4{\%}) compared to TA(6)/TA(6) genotype (2.2{\%}; P=0.015). Response rates among genotypes were not different for both regimens: combination regimen, P=0.537; single-agent, P=0.595. TA(7) homozygotes did not receive a lower median irinotecan dose, number of cycles (P-values {\textgreater}or=0.25) or more frequent dose reductions compared to the other genotypes (P-values for trend; combination therapy: 0.62 and single-agent: 0.45). Reductions were mainly ({\textgreater}80{\%}) owing to grade {\textgreater}or=3 diarrhoea, not (febrile) neutropenia. TA(7)/TA(7) patients have a higher incidence of febrile neutropenia upon irinotecan treatment, but were able to receive similar dose and number of cycles compared to other genotypes. Response rates were not significantly different.},

abstract = {A pharmacogenetic syndrome caused by molecular defects in the dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase gene (DPYD ) results in partial to complete loss of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) enzyme activity with patients exhibiting life-threatening toxicity following administration of routine doses of 5-fluorouracil. To date, more than 19 reported mutations have been putatively associated with DPD deficiency with 16 occurring within the open reading frame of the cDNA. The purpose of this study was to examine the conservation of functional domains (including the uracil, flavine adenine dinucleotide and NADPH binding sites) across three phyla (Chordata, Arthropoda and Nematoda) and the conservation of regions corresponding to the previously reported mutations. Comparative analysis of the uracil and NADPH binding sites in mammals and invertebrates demonstrated 100{\%} amino acid identity between mammals and Drosophila melanogaster. Caenorhabditis elegans demonstrated 89{\%} and 88{\%} identity in these domains, respectively. The mammalian sequences demonstrated 100{\%} identity in two iron sulphur motifs (amino acids 953-964 and 986-997) with significant conservation in D. melanogaster (92{\%} and 92{\%} identity, respectively) and C. elegans (100{\%} and 92{\%} identity, respectively). Comparative amino acid analysis revealed non-conservation in the loci of four DPYD mutations [DPYD*12 (R21Q), DPYD*5 (I543V), DPYD*6 (V732I), DPYD*9A (C29R)]. Seven mutations occurred in highly conserved regions [M166V, DPYD*8 (R235W), DPYD*11 (V335l), DPYD*4 (S534N), DPYD*9B (R886H), D949V, DPYD*10 (V995F)]. In summary, this comparative analysis identified conserved regions which may be critical to enzyme structure and/or function. The conservation of loci where DPYD mutations occur was also examined to evaluate their functional significance on DPD enzyme activity. These data should prove useful in the evaluation of newly discovered mutations in the DPYD gene.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Although single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of the dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase gene (DPYD) have been reported, which affect enzyme activity and the severity of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) toxicity, no pretherapeutic detection has thus far been developed. We investigated 22 DPYD gene SNPs, their respective incidence, their link with grade 3 to 4 toxic side effects, and their management in practice: 9 were looked for in 487 patients, whereas 13 others were investigated in 171 patients.$\backslash$nPATIENTS AND METHODS: SNPs were detected before 5-FU-based treatment in WBC using a Pyrosequencing method. Close clinical and biological follow-up was done.$\backslash$nRESULTS: Five different SNPs were found in 187 patients (IVS14 + 1G{\textgreater}A, 2846A{\textgreater}T, 1679T{\textgreater}G, 85T{\textgreater}C, -1590T{\textgreater}C). Three hundred patients had no SNP. Forty-four patients had grade 3 to 4 toxic side effects in either the first or second cycle. Sixty percent of patients with either IVS14 + 1G{\textgreater}A or 2846A{\textgreater}T SNPs and the only patient with 1679T{\textgreater}G SNP experienced early grade 3 to 4 toxicity, compared with 0{\%}, 5.5{\%}, and 15{\%} of those with either -1590T{\textgreater}C, 85T{\textgreater}C SNP, or no SNP, respectively. In cases with grade 3 to 4 toxicity, treatment either had to be quickly stopped, or could be safely continued with an individual dose adjustment. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the detection of these three major SNPs as toxicity predictive factors were 0.31, 0.98, and 0.62 and 0.94, respectively.$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Pretreatment detection of three DPYD SNPs could help to avoid severe toxic side effects. This approach is suitable for clinical practice and should be compared or combined with pharmacologic approaches. In the case of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency, 5-FU administration often can be safely continued with an individual dose adjustment.},

abstract = {DNA isolated from paraffin-embedded tissues has been used for analysis of DNA alterations in disease states. Use of archival tissue can expedite the gathering of large numbers of specimens from rare disease subtypes that would take years to accumulate prospectively. Therefore, archival tissues from 70 ovarian cancer cases diagnosed before or at age 40 were retrieved for analysis of BRCA1 mutations. DNA was isolated from paraffin-embedded tissue of 70 ovarian cancer cases diagnosed before or at age 40. BRCA1 mutation analysis was conducted by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and DNA sequencing. Fifty-eight BRCA1 mutations were found in 34 of the 70 ovarian cancer cases. Twenty-two cases had one mutation each and 12 cases had multiple mutations. Multiple mutations found in histologically normal tissue of 2 cases were not present in matched tumor tissue. For another case, DNA from two separate blocks of normal tissue contained different mutations. These observations were anomalous and suggested that mutations detected in fixed tissues may be artifacts of tissue preservation and not present in the original unfixed tissues. To test this suggestion, blood was obtained from 2 patients for whom mutations were found in fixed, normal tissue. DNA from their unfixed lymphocytes did not contain the mutations found in fixed normal tissue. Thus, mutations found in fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues can be artifacts of tissue preservation. The reliability of DNA sequence data derived from such tissues must be questioned in the absence of corroborating data from unfixed tissues. This severely limits the use of fixed tissues as a source of DNA for retrospective research and for clinical genetic testing in families for which a disease-affected member is not alive.},

abstract = {Background: The best-known cause of intolerance to fluoropyrimidines is dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency, which can result from deleterious polymorphisms in the gene encoding DPD (DPYD), including DPYD*2A and c.2846A{\textgreater}T. Three other variants-DPYD c.1679T{\textgreater}G, c.1236G{\textgreater}A/HapB3, and c.1601G{\textgreater}A-have been associated with DPD deficiency, but no definitive evidence for the clinical validity of these variants is available. The primary objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the clinical validity of c.1679T{\textgreater}G, c.1236G{\textgreater}A/HapB3, and c.1601G{\textgreater}A as predictors of severe fluoropyrimidine-associated toxicity. Methods: We did a systematic review of the literature published before Dec 17, 2014, to identify cohort studies investigating associations between DPYD c.1679T{\textgreater}G, c.1236G{\textgreater}A/HapB3, and c.1601G{\textgreater}A and severe (grade ≥3) fluoropyrimidine-associated toxicity in patients treated with fluoropyrimidines (fluorouracil, capecitabine, or tegafur-uracil as single agents, in combination with other anticancer drugs, or with radiotherapy). Individual patient data were retrieved and analysed in a multivariable analysis to obtain an adjusted relative risk (RR). Effect estimates were pooled by use of a random-effects meta-analysis. The threshold for significance was set at a p value of less than 0{\textperiodcentered}0167 (Bonferroni correction). Findings: 7365 patients from eight studies were included in the meta-analysis. DPYD c.1679T{\textgreater}G was significantly associated with fluoropyrimidine-associated toxicity (adjusted RR 4{\textperiodcentered}40, 95{\%} CI 2{\textperiodcentered}08-9{\textperiodcentered}30, p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001), as was c.1236G{\textgreater}A/HapB3 (1{\textperiodcentered}59, 1{\textperiodcentered}29-1{\textperiodcentered}97, p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001). The association between c.1601G{\textgreater}A and fluoropyrimidine-associated toxicity was not significant (adjusted RR 1{\textperiodcentered}52, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}86-2{\textperiodcentered}70, p=0{\textperiodcentered}15). Analysis of individual types of toxicity showed consistent associations of c.1679T{\textgreater}G and c.1236G{\textgreater}A/HapB3 with gastrointestinal toxicity (adjusted RR 5{\textperiodcentered}72, 95{\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}40-23{\textperiodcentered}33, p=0{\textperiodcentered}015; and 2{\textperiodcentered}04, 1{\textperiodcentered}49-2{\textperiodcentered}78, p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001, respectively) and haematological toxicity (adjusted RR 9{\textperiodcentered}76, 95{\%} CI 3{\textperiodcentered}03-31{\textperiodcentered}48, p=0{\textperiodcentered}00014; and 2{\textperiodcentered}07, 1{\textperiodcentered}17-3{\textperiodcentered}68, p=0{\textperiodcentered}013, respectively), but not with hand-foot syndrome. DPYD*2A and c.2846A{\textgreater}T were also significantly associated with severe fluoropyrimidine-associated toxicity (adjusted RR 2{\textperiodcentered}85, 95{\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}75-4{\textperiodcentered}62, p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001; and 3{\textperiodcentered}02, 2{\textperiodcentered}22-4{\textperiodcentered}10, p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001, respectively). Interpretation: DPYD variants c.1679T{\textgreater}G and c.1236G{\textgreater}A/HapB3 are clinically relevant predictors of fluoropyrimidine-associated toxicity.

Germline findings in cancer susceptibility genes were concordant with the individual's cancer type in only 81 of 198 cases (40.9{\%}; 95{\%} CI, 34.3{\%}-47.9{\%}). In individuals with PPGVs retained in the tumor, somatic alteration of the other allele was seen in 39 of 182 cases (21.4{\%}; 95{\%} CI, 16.1{\%}-28.0{\%}), of which 13 cases did not show a known correlation of the germline mutation and a known syndrome.

abstract = {The incidence of endometrial cancer, a common gynecological malignancy, is increasing in Japan. We have previously shown that the ER/MDM2/p53/p21 pathway plays an important role in endometrial carcinogenesis. In the present study, we investigated the effects of germline single nucleotide polymorphisms in murine double minute 2 (MDM2) SNP309, TP53 Arg72Pro, ESR1 PvuII and XbaI, and p21 codon 31 on endometrial cancer risk. We evaluated these polymorphisms in DNA samples from 125 endometrial cancer cases and 200 controls using polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism. The association of each genetic polymorphism with endometrial cancer was examined by the odds ratio and 95{\%} confidence interval, which were obtained using logistic regression analysis. The SNP309 GG genotype non-significantly increased the risk of endometrial cancer. The 95{\%} confidence interval for the GG genotype vs. the TT genotype of MDM2 SNP309 was 1.76 (0.93-3.30). Endometrial cancer was not associated with tested SNP genotypes for TP53, ESR1 and p21. The combination of SNP309 GG + TG and TP53 codon 72 Arg/Arg significantly increased endometrial cancer risk. The adjusted OR was 2.53 (95{\%} confidence interval, 1.03-6.21) and P for the interaction was 0.04. This result was supported by in vitro data showing that endometrial cancer cell lines with the SNP309 G allele failed to show growth inhibition by treatment with RITA, which reduces p53-MDM2 binding. The presence of the SNP309 G allele and TP53 codon 72 Arg/Arg genotype is associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer in Japanese women.},

Toxicity was documented according to World Health Organization grades. DPYD, TYMS, and MTHFR genotypes were determined, and DPYD was resequenced in patients with severe toxicity.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Grade 3 to 4 toxicity occurred in 16.1{\%} of patients. The sensitivity of DPYD*2A genotyping for overall toxicity was 5.5{\%} (95{\%}CI, 0.02 to 0.11), with a positive predictive value of 0.46 (95{\%} CI, 0.19 to 0.75; P = .01). Inclusion of additional DPYD variants improved prediction only marginally. Analysis according to toxicity type revealed significant association of DPYD with mucositis and leukopenia, whereas TYMS was associated with diarrhea. Genotype, female sex, mode of FU administration, and modulation by folinic acid were identified as independent risk factors by multivariable analysis. A previously unrecognized significant interaction was found between sex and DPYD, which resulted in an odds ratio for toxicity of 41.8 for male patients (95{\%} CI, 9.2 to 190; P {\textless} .0001) but only 1.33 (95{\%} CI, 0.34 to 5.2) in female patients. Homozygosity for the TYMS enhancer region double repeat allele increased risk for toxicity 1.6-fold (95{\%} CI, 1.08 to 2.22; P = .02).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: DPYD, TYMS, and MTHFR play a limited role for FU related toxicity but a pronounced DPYD gene/sex-interaction increases prediction rate for male patients.

abstract = {Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies are used to detect somatic mutations in tumors and study germ line variation. Most NGS studies use DNA isolated from whole blood or fresh frozen tissue. However, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues are one of the most widely available clinical specimens. Their potential utility as a source of DNA for NGS would greatly enhance population-based cancer studies. While preliminary studies suggest FFPE tissue may be used for NGS, the feasibility of using archived FFPE specimens in population based studies and the effect of storage time on these specimens needs to be determined. We conducted a study to determine whether DNA in archived FFPE high-grade ovarian serous adenocarcinomas from Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registries Residual Tissue Repositories (RTR) was present in sufficient quantity and quality for NGS assays. Fifty-nine FFPE tissues, stored from 3 to 32 years, were obtained from three SEER RTR sites. DNA was extracted, quantified, quality assessed, and subjected to whole exome sequencing (WES). Following DNA extraction, 58 of 59 specimens (98{\%}) yielded DNA and moved on to the library generation step followed by WES. Specimens stored for longer periods of time had significantly lower coverage of the target region (6{\%} lower per 10 years, 95{\%} CI: 3-10{\%}) and lower average read depth (40x lower per 10 years, 95{\%} CI: 18-60), although sufficient quality and quantity of WES data was obtained for data mining. Overall, 90{\%} (53/59) of specimens provided usable NGS data regardless of storage time. This feasibility study demonstrates FFPE specimens acquired from SEER registries after varying lengths of storage time and under varying storage conditions are a promising source of DNA for NGS.},

Characteristic nucleotide combinations on single chromosomes (haplotype) generated block structures, including SNPs, that differed between patients and controls. Using a permutation test to detect differences in haplotype distribution between groups, the CCATTGA and the CCGAA haplotypes in the IRF-1 gene were more frequent in NIS (p = 0.03) and in HCV patients (p = 0.001) than in controls.

abstract = {5-Fluorouracil is among the most widely used anticancer drug, but a fraction of treated patients develop severe toxicity, with potentially lethal injuries. The predictive power of the available pretreatment assays, used to identify patients at risk of severe toxicity, needs improvements. This study aimed to correlate a phenotypic marker of 5-fluorouracil metabolism (the individual degradation rate of 5-fluorouracil-5-FUDR) with 15 functional polymorphisms in the dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase gene (DPYD). Single SNP (single-nucleotide polymorphism) analysis revealed that the SNPs rs1801160, rs1801265, rs2297595 and rs3918290 (splice site variant IVS14+1G{\textgreater}A) were significantly associated with a decreased value of 5-FUDR, and the rs3918290 causing the larger decrease. Multi-SNP analysis showed that a three-SNP haplotype (Hap7) involving rs1801160, rs1801265 and rs2297595 causes a marked decrease in 5-FUDR, comparable to that caused by the splice site variant rs3918290, which is the main pharmacogenetic marker associated with severe fluorouracil toxicity. The similar effect played by Hap7 and by the splice site variant rs3918290 upon individual 5-FUDR suggests that Hap7 could also represent a similar determinant of fluorouracil toxicity. Haplotype assessment could improve the predictive value of DPYD genetic markers aimed at the pre-emptive identification of patients at risk of severe 5-fluorouracil toxicity.The Pharmacogenomics Journal advance online publication, 28 July 2015; doi:10.1038/tpj.2015.56.},

Furthermore, multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis was used to identify a genetic interaction profile indicating an increased risk of toxicity.$\backslash$nResults: Alleles associated with low activity of methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) were associated with decreased risk of toxicity [ORExploration 0.39 (95{\%} CI: 0.21–0.71, P = 0.003), ORValidation 0.63 (95{\%} CI: 0.41–0.95, P = 0.03)]. A specific combination of the MTHFR 1298A{\textgreater}C and thymidylate synthase (TYMS) 3′-UTR (untranslated region) ins/del polymorphisms was significantly associated with increased toxicity in both cohorts [ORExploration 2.40 (95{\%} CI: 1.33–4.29, P = 0.003), ORValidation 1.81 (95{\%} CI: 1.18–2.79, P = 0.007)]. The specific combination was also associated with increased cumulative incidence and earlier occurrence of severe toxicity during treatment.$\backslash$nConclusions: Our results indicate that MTHFR activity and a specific combination of the MTHFR 1298A{\textgreater}C and TYMS 3′-UTR ins/del polymorphisms are possible predictors of 5-FU treatment–related toxicity.

abstract = {In this marker evaluation study, we tested whether distinct patterns of functional genomic polymorphisms in genes involved in drug metabolic pathways and DNA repair that predict clinical outcome to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/oxaliplatin chemotherapy in patients with advanced colorectal cancer could be identified. Functional polymorphisms in DNA-repair genes XPD, ERCC1, XRCC1, XPA, and metabolising genes glutathione S-transferase GSTP1, GSTT1, GSTM1, and thymidylate synthase (TS) were assessed retrospectively in 106 patients with refractory stage IV disease who received 5-FU/oxaliplatin combination chemotherapy, using a polymerase chain reaction-based RFLP technique. Favourable genotypes from polymorphisms in XPD-751, ERCC1-118, GSTP1-105, and TS-3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) that are associated with overall survival were identified. After adjustment for performance status, the relative risks of dying for patients who possessed the unfavourable genotype were: 3.33 for XPD-751 (P=0.037), 3.25 for GSTP1-105 (P=0.072), 2.05 for ERCC1-118 (P=0.037), and 1.65 for TS-3'UTR (P=0.091) when compared to their respective beneficial genomic variants. Combination analysis with all four polymorphisms revealed that patients possessing {\textgreater} or =2 favourable genotypes survived a median of 17.4 months (95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 9.4, 26.5) compared to 5.4 months (95{\%} CI: 4.3, 6.0) in patients with no favourable genotype. Patients who carried one favourable genotype demonstrated intermediate survival of 10.2 months (95{\%} CI: 6.8, 15.3; P{\textless}0.001). Polymorphisms in the TS-3'UTR and GSTP1-105 gene were also associated with time to progression. After adjustment for performance status, patients with an unfavourable TS-3'UTR genotype had a relative risk of disease progression of 1.76 (P=0.020) and those with the unfavourable GSTP1-105 genotype showed a relative risk of progression of 2.00 (P=0.018). The genomic polymorphisms XPD-751, ERCC1-118, GSTP1-105, and TS-3'UTR may be useful in predicting overall survival and time to progression of colorectal cancer in patients who receive 5-FU/oxaliplatin chemotherapy. These findings require independent prospective confirmation.},

abstract = {Glucuronidation catalyzed by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) is one of the most important mechanisms for host defense against xenobiotics and endobiotics. Although genetic polymorphisms of several UGT1A isoforms have been reported separately, the haplotypes in all functional exons have not been identified, and little information is available regarding single nucleotide polymorphisms in Koreans. We analyzed genetic polymorphisms in all functional exons of the UGT1A locus by direct sequencing of genomic DNA from 50 healthy Korean subjects, and their haplotypes were inferred from genotype data using an expectation-maximization algorithm. We identified 67 polymorphisms, including three novel single nucleotide polymorphisms, 233C{\textgreater}T in UGT1A1 (T78M), 292C{\textgreater}T in 1A4 (Q98Stop), and 701T{\textgreater}C in 1A7 (I234T). Two amino acid substitutions, 1A4 Q98Stop and 1A7 I234T, were each associated with a decrease of enzymatic activity, whereas UGT1A1 T78M had no significant influence on catalytic function. The frequencies of the known variants in Koreans differed significantly from those reported in other ethnic groups. Haplotype analysis was performed within the polymorphisms in each UGT1A isoform as well as across the isoforms. Based on strong linkage disequilibrium within UGT1A7, between 1A5 and 1A4, and within 1A3, the complex was divided into three blocks, Block 7, Block 5/4, and Block 3. The haplotypes for each block were subsequently determined, revealing a profile that differed from those of other ethnic groups. These results suggest that genetic polymorphisms of the UGT1A locus differ between Koreans and other ethnic populations. Such differences should be considered in pharmacogenetic studies.},

abstract = {Individuals who inherit mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 are predisposed to breast and ovarian cancers. However, identifying mutations in these large genes by conventional dideoxy sequencing in a clinical testing laboratory is both time consuming and costly, and similar challenges exist for other large genes, or sets of genes, with relevance in the clinical setting. Second-generation sequencing technologies have the potential to improve the efficiency and throughput of clinical diagnostic sequencing, once clinically validated methods become available. We have developed a method for detection of variants based on automated small-amplicon PCR followed by sample pooling and sequencing with a second-generation instrument. To demonstrate the suitability of this method for clinical diagnostic sequencing, we analyzed the coding exons and the intron-exon boundaries of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in 91 hereditary breast cancer patient samples. Our method generated high-quality sequence coverage across all targeted regions, with median coverage greater than 4000-fold for each sample in pools of 24. Sensitive and specific automated variant detection, without false-positive or false-negative results, was accomplished with a standard software pipeline using bwa for sequence alignment and samtools for variant detection. We experimentally derived a minimum threshold of 100-fold sequence depth for confident variant detection. The results demonstrate that this method is suitable for sensitive, automatable, high-throughput sequence variant detection in the clinical laboratory.

abstract = {Over 15,000 human tumor p53 mutations have been recorded in the scientific literature, including over 700 mutations in esophageal tumors. There are no data on p53 mutations in esophageal cancer patients from Iran yet; however, this country experiences one of the highest cancer mortality rates in the world for esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs). The causes of this high cancer burden in Iran remain obscure and do not appear to be related to tobacco and alcohol consumption, the two major risk factors identified in Europe and North America. Because molecular analysis of tumors can provide clues to endogenous or environmental factors contributing to high cancer risk, we examined 74 Iranian ESCCs for the presence of mutations in exons 5-8 of the p53 gene by PCR and direct sequencing. Forty-eight of the 74 tumors (65{\%}) had one or more p53 gene point mutations, including 5 patients with two or more mutations and one with a tandem mutation in codon 242. Surprisingly, over one-third of the 54 mutations we identified were transitions at CpG sites (20 of a total of 54 mutations, or 37{\%}), a class of mutation that is significantly less common (16{\%} of mutations) in the compilation of ESCC mutations from other countries (chi2 statistic, P {\textless} 0.0002), whereas transversions, which the literature shows to be common in ESCCs from non-Iranian patients, were infrequent in the tumors we examined here. Elevated levels of cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase were observed in 74 and 91{\%}, respectively, of tumors from Tehran as determined by immunohistochemistry, and high COX-2 expression correlated significantly with the presence of a p53 mutation in the tumor. Mediators of the inflammatory response in esophageal mucosa, perhaps in conjunction with specific dietary or cultural practices in Iran, may contribute importantly to the p53 mutation load in Iranian ESCC patients.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Precision medicine is dependent on identifying actionable mutations in tumors. Accurate detection of mutations is often problematic in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. DNA extracted from formalin-fixed tissues is fragmented and also contains DNA lesions that are the sources of sequence artifacts. Sequence artifacts can be difficult to distinguish from true mutations, especially in the context of tumor heterogeneity, and are an increasing interpretive problem in this era of massively parallel sequencing. Understanding of the sources of sequence artifacts in FFPE tissues and implementation of preventative strategies are critical to improve the accurate detection of actionable mutations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONTENT: This mini-review focuses on DNA template lesions in FFPE tissues as the source of sequence artifacts in molecular analysis. In particular, fragmentation, base modification (including uracil and thymine deriving from cytosine deamination), and abasic sites are discussed as indirect or direct sources of sequence artifacts. We discuss strategies that can be implemented to minimize sequence artifacts and to distinguish true mutations from sequence artifacts. These strategies are applicable for the detection of actionable mutations in both single amplicon and massively parallel amplicon sequencing approaches.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSUMMARY: Because FFPE tissues are usually the only available material for DNA analysis, it is important to maximize the accurate informational content from FFPE DNA. Careful consideration of each step in the work flow is needed to minimize sequence artifacts. In addition, validation of actionable mutations either by appropriate experimental design or by orthogonal methods should be considered.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The objective is to investigate whether polymorphisms with putative influence on fluorouracil/oxaliplatin activity are associated with clinical outcomes of patients with advanced colorectal cancer treated with first-line oxaliplatin, folinic acid, and fluorouracil palliative chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients were prospectively enrolled onto medical oncology units in Central Italy. Patients were required to have cytologically/histologically confirmed metastatic disease with at least one measurable lesion. Peripheral blood samples were used for genotyping 12 polymorphisms in thymidylate synthase, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, xeroderma pigmentosum group D (XPD), excision repair cross complementing group 1 (ERCC1), x-ray cross complementing group 1, x-ray cross complementing protein 3, glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) genes. The primary end point of the study was to investigate the association between genotypes and progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: In 166 patients, ERCC1-118 T/T, XPD-751 A/C, and XPD-751 C/C genotypes were independently associated with adverse PFS. The presence of two risk genotypes (ERCC1-118 T/T combined with either XPD-751 A/C or XPD-751 C/C) occurred in 50 patients (31{\%}). This profiling showed an independent role for unfavorable PFS with a hazard ratio of 2.84{\%} and 95{\%} CI of 1.47 to 5.45 (P = .002). Neurotoxicity was significantly associated with GSTP1-105 A/G. Carriers of the GSTP1-105 G/G genotype were more prone to suffer from grade 3 neurotoxicity than carriers of GSTP1-105 A/G and GSTP1-105 A/A genotypes. CONCLUSION: A pharmacogenetic approach may be an innovative strategy for optimizing palliative chemotherapy in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. These findings deserve confirmation in additional prospective studies.},

abstract = {More than ten million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified in humans; however, the importance of most SNPs for health and disease is not understood. Most SNPs are indeed unimportant and because of often inadequately powered studies, many observations on SNP effects can not be repeated by other researchers. SNPs are at best shown to influence protein function or level, rarely to influence risk of disease, and almost never to influence total mortality, the ultimate endpoint. A wellknown functional SNP in the tumor suppressor TP53 gene leads to increased longevity: in the Danish general population (n = 9219) homozygotes for the minor allele versus homozygotes for the major allele had an increase in median survival of 3 years. This is partly explained by increased survival after development of cancer or other diseases, in accordance with the observation that this Arg72Pro substitution in the p53 protein has important influence on cell death via increased apoptosis. Thus, the increased longevity may be due to a generally increased robustness after a diagnosis of any life-threatening disease. In contrast to widespread skepticism on the importance of SNPs in humans, this gain-of-function p53 SNP of importance for cell repair mechanisms has a profound influence on longevity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues are routinely used for detecting mutational biomarkers in patients with cancer. A previous intractable challenge with FFPE DNA in genetic testing has been the high number of artifactual single-nucleotide changes (SNCs), particularly for the detection of low-level mutations. Pretreatment of FFPE DNA with uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) can markedly reduce these C:G{\textgreater}T:A SNCs with a small panel of amplicons. This procedure has implications for massively parallel sequencing approaches to mutation detection from DNA. We investigated whether sequence artifacts were problematic in amplicon-based massively parallel sequencing and what effect UDG pretreatment had on reducing these artifacts.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We amplified selected amplicons from lung cancer FFPE DNAs using the TruSeq Cancer Panel. SNCs occurring at a frequency {\textless}10{\%} were considered most likely to represent sequence artifacts and were enumerated for both UDG-treated and -untreated DNAs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Massively parallel sequencing of FFPE DNA samples showed multiple SNCs, predominantly C:G{\textgreater}T:A changes, with a significant proportion occurring above the background sequencing error (defined as 1{\%}). UDG pretreatment markedly reduced C:G{\textgreater}T:A SNCs without affecting the detection of true somatic mutations. However, C:G{\textgreater}T:A changes within CpG dinucleotides were often resistant to the UDG treatment as a consequence of 5-methyl cytosine being deaminated to thymine rather than uracil.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: UDG pretreatment greatly facilitates the accurate discrimination of mutations in FFPE samples by use of amplicon-based approaches. This is particularly important when working with samples with low tumor purity or for the assessment of mutational heterogeneity in tumors.},

Our aim was to investigate the association of p53 Arg72Pro polymorphism with the clinical outcome of gastric cancer patients treated with 5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy. METHODS: The p53 codon 72 genotype was determined in blood samples from 110 Chinese patients with gastric cancer treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based adjuvant chemotherapy, using polymerase chain reaction-ligation detection reaction (PCR-LDR) method. RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that gastric cancer patients with Pro/Pro genotype had shorter relapse-free survival (chi(2) = 10.632, P = 0.005) and overall survival (chi(2) = 7.104, P = 0.029) than patients with other genotypes. Cox multivariate analysis showed that Pro/Pro genotype was associated with statistically significant reduced relapse-free survival (adjusted OR = 3.049, 95{\%} CI: 1.363-6.819, P = 0.007) and overall survival (adjusted OR = 2.581, 95{\%} CI: 1.052-6.330, P = 0.038).

abstract = {Irinotecan unexpectedly causes severe toxicity of leukopenia or diarrhea. Irinotecan is metabolized to form active SN-38, which is further conjugated and detoxified by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 enzyme. Genetic polymorphisms of the UGT1A1 would affect an interindividual variation of the toxicity by irinotecan via the alternation of bioavailability of SN-38. In this case-control study, retrospective review of clinical records and determination of UGT1A1 polymorphisms were performed to investigate whether a patient with the variant UGT1A1 genotypes would be at higher risk for severe toxicity by irinotecan. All patients previously received irinotecan against cancer in university hospitals, cancer centers, or large urban hospitals in Japan. We identified 26 patients who experienced severe toxicity and 92 patients who did not. The relationship was studied between the multiple variant genotypes (UGT1A1*28 in the promoter and UGT1A1*6, UGT1A1*27, UGT1A1*29, and UGT1A1*7 in the coding region) and the severe toxicity of grade 4 leukopenia ({\textless} or =0.9 x 10(9)/liter) and/or grade 3 (watery for 5 days or more) or grade 4 (hemorrhagic or dehydration) diarrhea. Of the 26 patients with the severe toxicity, the genotypes of UGT1A1*28 were homozygous in 4 (15{\%}) and heterozygous in 8 (31{\%}), whereas 3 (3{\%}) homozygous and 10 (11{\%}) heterozygous were found among the 92 patients without the severe toxicity. Multivariate analysis suggested that the genotype either heterozygous or homozygous for UGT1A1*28 would be a significant risk factor for severe toxicity by irinotecan (P {\textless} 0.001; odds ratio, 7.23; 95{\%} confidence interval, 2.52-22.3). All 3 patients heterozygous for UGT1A1*27 encountered severe toxicity. No statistical association of UGT1A1*6 with the occurrence of severe toxicity was observed. None had UGT1A1*29 or UGT1A1*7. We suggest that determination of the UGT1A1 genotypes might be clinically useful for predicting severe toxicity by irinotecan in cancer patients. This research warrants a prospective trial to corroborate the usefulness of gene diagnosis of UGT1A1 polymorphisms prior tb irinotecan chemotherapy.},

abstract = {We show that DNA molecules amplified by PCR from DNA extracted from animal bones and teeth that vary in age between 25 000 and over 50 000 years carry C--{\textgreater}T and G--{\textgreater}A substitutions. These substitutions can reach high proportions among the molecules amplified and are due to the occurrence of modified deoxycytidine residues in the template DNA. If the template DNA is treated with uracil N-glycosylase, these substitutions are dramatically reduced. They are thus likely to result from deamination of deoxycytidine residues. In addition, 'jumping PCR', i.e. the occurrence of template switching during PCR, may contribute to these substitutions. When DNA sequences are amplified from ancient DNA extracts where few template molecules initiate the PCR, precautions such as DNA sequence determination of multiple clones derived from more than one independent amplification are necessary in order to reduce the risk of determination of incorrect DNA sequences. When such precautionary measures are taken, errors induced by damage to the DNA template are unlikely to be more frequent than approximately 0.1{\%} even under the unlikely scenario where each amplification starts from a single template molecule.},

abstract = {A TP53 gene polymorphism, resulting in an arginine (R) to proline (P) at codon 72 (TP53 R72P), has been associated with the susceptibility to various cancers. To better understand the role of this polymorphism in colorectal cancer etiology, we examined the association between TP53 R72P and colorectal cancer risk in 345 patients with colorectal cancer and 670 controls in a Chinese population. We observed that subjects with RP and PP genotypes had a 1.60-fold and a 2.37-fold increased risk for colorectal cancer, respectively. The 72P allele conferred a more pronounced increase in colorectal cancer risk among alcohol consumers (heterozygotes: OR = 3.01; homozygotes: OR = 4.71). The TP53 R72P polymorphism was not linked to tumor location, histologic grade, lymph node metastases, Dukes stage, p53 positivity, or age at diagnosis, but to tumor size. We conclude that the TP53 R72P polymorphism may contribute to the etiology of colorectal cancer in the Chinese population, particularly among alcohol consumers.},

Characteristics such as sequencer read orientation and presence in both tumor and normal samples strongly indicated a non-biological mechanism.

We show generation of 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) lesions during DNA shearing, present analysis tools to detect oxidation in sequencing data and suggest methods to reduce DNA oxidation through the introduction of antioxidants. Further, informatics methods are presented to confidently filter these artifacts from sequencing data sets. Though only seen in a low percentage of reads in affected samples, such artifacts could have profoundly deleterious effects on the ability to confidently call rare mutations, and eliminating other possible sources of artifacts should become a priority for the research community.},

abstract = {mTOR regulates several cellular processes that are critical for tumorigenesis. However, previous studies on the association of mTOR polymorphisms with predisposition to different cancer types are somewhat contradictory. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and updated meta-analysis of the available evidence regarding the relationship between mTOR single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and cancer risk. Up to November 2015, 23 original publications were identified covering 20 mTOR SNPs, of which seven SNPs (rs2536, rs2295080, rs1883965, rs1034528, rs17036508, rs3806317 and rs1064261) were included in the final meta-analysis. We estimated the summary odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) for mTOR polymorphisms and cancer risk, and used the model-free approach to investigate the biological effect of each polymorphism. Our meta-analysis found that rs1883965, rs1034528, and rs17036508 were correlated with increased cancer risk in the complete over-dominant model (rs1883965 GA versus GG/AA: fixed-effects OR=1.15, 95{\%} CI 1.02-1.29; rs1034528 GC versus GG/CC: fixed-effects OR=1.30, 95{\%} CI 1.13-1.48; rs17036508 TC versus CC/TT: fixed-effects OR=1.23, 95{\%} CI 1.06-1.43). Stratifying analyses by cancer type, we found that the rs2295080 G allele was associated with a significantly higher risk of acute leukemia in the recessive model (GG versus GT/TT: fixed-effects OR=2.08, 95{\%} CI 1.34-3.22) and a lower risk of genitourinary cancers in the dominant model (TG/GG versus TT: fixed-effects OR=0.77, 95{\%} CI 0.68-0.86). Interestingly, further expression analysis showed that homozygous variant genotype carriers of rs1883965, rs1034528 and rs17036508 had lower mTOR transcript levels, based on HapMap data.},

abstract = {During the course of diagnostic surgical pathology, pathologists have established a large collection of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues that form invaluable resources for translational studies of cancer and a variety of other diseases. Accessibility of macromolecules in the fixed tissue specimens is a critical issue as exemplified by heat-induced antigen retrieval (AR) immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. On the basis of observations that heating may also enhance in situ hybridization (ISH) and the similarity of formalin-induced chemical modifications that occur in protein and in DNA, we designed a study to examine the efficiency of DNA extraction from archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues using an adaptation of the basic principles of the AR technique, i.e., heating the tissue under the influence of different pH values. Archival paraffin blocks of lymph nodes, tonsil, and colon were randomly selected. Each paraffin block was prepared in 34 microtubes. For each paraffin block, one tube was used as a control sample, using a non-heating DNA extraction protocol. The other 33 tubes were tested using a heating protocol under 11 variable pH values (pH 2 to 12) under three different heating conditions (80, 100, and 120C). Evaluation of the results of DNA extraction was carried out by measuring yields by photometry and PCR amplification, as well as kinetic thermocycling (KTC)-PCR methods. In general, lower pH (acid) solutions gave inferior results to solutions at higher pH (alkaline). Heating tissues at a higher temperature and at pH 6-9 gave higher yields of DNA. There appeared to be a peak in terms of highest efficiency of extracted DNA at around pH 9. The average ratios 260:280 of extracted DNA also showed better values for samples heated at 120C. PCR products of three primers showed satisfactory results for DNA extracted from archival paraffin-embedded tissues by heating protocols at pH 6-12, with results that were comparable to the control sample subjected to the standard non-heating, enzymatic DNA extraction method. This study is the first to document the use of heating at an alkaline pH for DNA extraction from archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues, a recommendation based on the principles of AR for protein IHC. These findings may lead to a more effective protocol for DNA extraction from archival paraffin-embedded tissues and may also provide enhanced understanding of changes that occur during formalin-induced modification of nucleic acids.},

The point mutation was 28.21{\%}, 28.46{\%}, and 27.97{\%} in patients with NSCLC, ADC and SCC, respectively. Men had an equivalent mutation (27.18{\%}) to women (30.77{\%}). The mutation in smokers and nonsmokers was 27.68{\%} and 29.17{\%}, respectively. In unselected patients, there was no correlation between EGFR exon 20 mutations and patients' characteristics of age, gender, smoking history, histologic type, or tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system.

abstract = {Background: Clinical specimens undergoing diagnostic molecular pathology testing are fixed in formalin due to the necessity for detailed morphological assessment. However, formalin fixation can cause major issues with molecular testing, as it causes DNA damage such as fragmentation and non-reproducible sequencing artefacts after PCR amplification. In the context of massively parallel sequencing (MPS), distinguishing true low frequency variants from sequencing artefacts remains challenging. The prevalence of formalin-induced DNA damage and its impact on molecular testing and clinical genomics remains poorly understood. Methods: The Cancer 2015 study is a population-based cancer cohort used to assess the feasibility of mutational screening using MPS in cancer patients from Victoria, Australia. While blocks were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded in different anatomical pathology laboratories, they were centrally extracted for DNA utilising the same protocol, and run through the same MPS platform (Illumina TruSeq Amplicon Cancer Panel). The sequencing artefacts in the 1-10{\%} and the 10-25{\%} allele frequency ranges were assessed in 488 formalin-fixed tumours from the pilot phase of the Cancer 2015 cohort. All blocks were less than 2.5 years of age (mean 93 days). Results: Consistent with the signature of DNA damage due to formalin fixation, many formalin-fixed samples displayed disproportionate levels of C{\textgreater}T/G{\textgreater}A changes in the 1-10{\%} allele frequency range. Artefacts were less apparent in the 10-25{\%} allele frequency range. Significantly, changes were inversely correlated with coverage indicating high levels of sequencing artefacts were associated with samples with low amounts of available amplifiable template due to fragmentation. The degree of fragmentation and sequencing artefacts differed between blocks sourced from different anatomical pathology laboratories. In a limited validation of potentially actionable low frequency mutations, a NRAS G12D mutation in a melanoma was shown to be a false positive. Conclusions: These findings indicate that DNA damage following formalin fixation remains a major challenge in laboratories working with MPS. Methodologies that assess, minimise or remove formalin-induced DNA damaged templates as part of MPS protocols will aid in the interpretation of genomic results leading to better patient outcomes.},

abstract = {Although the last few years have seen great progress in DNA sequence retrieval from fossil specimens, some of the characteristics of ancient DNA remain poorly understood. This is particularly true for blocking lesions, i.e. chemical alterations that cannot be bypassed by DNA polymerases and thus prevent amplification and subsequent sequencing of affected molecules. Some studies have concluded that the vast majority of ancient DNA molecules carry blocking lesions, suggesting that the removal, repair or bypass of blocking lesions might dramatically increase both the time depth and geographical range of specimens available for ancient DNA analysis. However, previous studies used very indirect detection methods that did not provide conclusive estimates on the frequency of blocking lesions in endogenous ancient DNA. We developed a new method, polymerase extension profiling (PEP), that directly reveals occurrences of polymerase stalling on DNA templates. By sequencing thousands of single primer extension products using PEP methodology, we have for the first time directly identified blocking lesions in ancient DNA on a single molecule level. Although we found clear evidence for blocking lesions in three out of four ancient samples, no more than 40{\%} of the molecules were affected in any of the samples, indicating that such modifications are far less frequent in ancient DNA than previously thought.},

abstract = {Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) controls intracellular CH2FH4 concentrations (required for optimal fluoropyrimidine efficacy) by irreversibly converting CH2FH4 into 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. MTHFR 677C{\textgreater}T and 1298A{\textgreater}C polymorphisms are linked to altered enzyme activity. Thus, mutated MTHFR tumours should, in theory, be more sensitive to 5-fluorouracil (5FU) than wild-type tumours. MTHFR polymorphisms in position 677 and 1298 were analysed in 98 colorectal cancer patients with unresectable liver metastases (57 men, 41 women, mean age 64 years) receiving 5FU-folinic acid. 677C{\textgreater}T and 1298A{\textgreater}C genotypes were determined simultaneously by melting curve analyses on liver metastases. 677C{\textgreater}T genotype distribution was 46.9{\%} wt/wt, 34.7{\%} wt/mut and 18.4{\%} mut/mut; that of 1298A{\textgreater}C was 52.0{\%} wt/wt, 35.7{\%} wt/mut and 12.3{\%} mut/mut. The response rate was not related to 1298A{\textgreater}C genotype but was significantly linked to 677C{\textgreater}T genotype (response rate: 40{\%}, 21{\%} and 56{\%} in wt/wt, wt/mut and mut/mut, respectively; P = 0.040), with an increased response rate in mut/mut tumours relative to wt/wt (odds ratio = 1.88). Thymidylate synthase activity measured in metastases was a significant predictor of 5FU responsiveness and the addition of the 677C{\textgreater}T genotype improved model prediction. MTHFR 1298A{\textgreater}C polymorphism was significantly linked to specific survival, with homozygous mutated patients having the worst prognosis (P = 0.009, relative risk = 2.48 in mut/mut versus wt/wt). MTHFR 1298A{\textgreater}C genotype remained a significant predictor in a multivariate analysis including metastasis characteristics. The results suggest that MTHFR genotypes are relevant and independent factors of patient outcome in 5FU-based treatment of advanced colorectal cancer.},

abstract = {AIMS: The importance of polymorphisms in the dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase gene (DPYD) for the prediction of severe toxicity in 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy is still unclear. This study aims to assess the predictive value of DPYD variation with respect to previously described DPYD variants for 5-FU toxicity. It represents the first analysis of the gene at the haplotype level, also capturing potentially important genetic variation located outside the coding regions of DPYD. MATERIALS {\&} METHODS: The entire coding sequence and exon-flanking intronic regions of DPYD were sequenced in 111 cancer patients receiving fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. DPYD haplotypes were inferred and their associations with severe 5-FU toxicity were assessed. RESULTS: None of the previously described deleterious variants (IVS14+1G{\textgreater}A, c.2846A{\textgreater}T and c.1679T{\textgreater}G) were detected in 24 patients who experienced severe 5-FU toxicity. A potential association was observed between a haplotype containing three novel intronic polymorphisms (IVS5+18G{\textgreater}A, IVS6+139G{\textgreater}A and IVS9-51T{\textgreater}G) and a synonymous mutation (c.1236G{\textgreater}A), which was observed five- out of eight-times in patients with severe adverse effects. CONCLUSION: The association of a haplotype containing no nonsynonymous or splice-site polymorphisms indicates that additional important genetic variation may be located in noncoding gene regions. Furthermore, a comparison with other studies suggests that the relative importance of particular DPYD mutations (IVS14+1G{\textgreater}A and c.2846A{\textgreater}T) for predicting severe 5-FU toxicity differs geographically across Europe.},

abstract = {DNA damage blocks DNA polymerase progression and increases miscoding. In this study, we assessed the effects of specific lesions on Taq DNA polymerase fidelity and amplification efficiency. In the presence of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2???-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG), Taq DNA polymerase inserted dCMP and to a lesser extent dAMP. 8-Oxo-7,8-dihydro-2???-deoxyadenosine (8-oxodA) instructed the incorporation of dTMP and caused a pronounced n - 1 deletion not observed in other systems. The presence of an abasic lesion led to dAMP incorporation and n - 1 deletions. In addition, we introduce the mean modified efficiency (MME) as a more precise method for determining PCR amplification efficiency of damaged templates. Using this method, we were able to quantify reductions in amplification efficiency of templates containing 8-oxodG (single or multiple), 8-oxodA, or abasic sites. Because the MME method can detect small reductions in amplification efficiency, it may be useful in comparing the extent of damage in environmentally degraded or archival DNA specimens. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Genetic factors are known to affect the efficiency of therapy with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). At present, the only accepted molecular marker predictive of the response to anti-EGFR mAbs is the somatic mutation of KRAS and NRAS as a marker of resistance to anti-EGFR. However, only a fraction of KRAS wild-type patients benefit from that treatment. In this study, we show that the EGFR gene polymorphism rs1050171 defines, independently of RAS mutational status, a sub-population of 11 {\%} of patients with a better clinical outcome after anti-EGFR treatment. Median PFS for patients with the GG genotype was 10.17 months compared to 5.37 of those with AG + AA genotypes. Taken together, our findings could be used to better define CRC populations responding to anti-EGFR therapy. Further studies in larger independent cohorts are necessary to validate the present observation that a synonymous polymorphism in EGFR gene impacts on clinical responsiveness.},
