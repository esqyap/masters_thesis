abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies have suggested the potential importance of three DPYD variants (DPYD*2A, D949V, and I560S) with increased 5-FU toxicity. Their individual associations, however, in 5-FU-based combination therapies, remain controversial and require further systematic study in a large patient population receiving comparable treatment regimens with uniform clinical data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We genotyped 2886 stage III colon cancer patients treated adjuvantly in a randomized phase III trial with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI, alone or combined with cetuximab, and tested the individual associations between functionally deleterious DPYD variants and toxicity. Logistic regressions were used to assess univariate and multivariable associations. All statistical tests were two-sided.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In 2594 patients with complete adverse event (AE) data, the incidence of grade 3 or greater 5FU-AEs in DPYD*2A, I560S, and D949V carriers were 22/25 (88.0{\%}), 2/4 (50.0{\%}), and 22/27 (81.5{\%}), respectively. Statistically significant associations were identified between grade 3 or greater 5FU-AEs and both DPYD*2A (odds ratio [OR] = 15.21, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 4.54 to 50.96, P {\textless} .001) and D949V (OR = 9.10, 95{\%} CI = 3.43 to 24.10, P {\textless} .001) variants. Statistical significance remained after adjusting for multiple variables. The DPYD*2A variant statistically significantly associated with the specific AEs nausea/vomiting (P = .007) and neutropenia (P {\textless} .001), whereas D949V statistically significantly associated with dehydration (P = .02), diarrhea (P = .003), leukopenia (P = .002), neutropenia (P {\textless} .001), and thrombocytopenia (P {\textless} .001). Although two patients with I560S had grade≥3 5FU-AEs; a statistically significant association could not be demonstrated because of its low frequency (P = .48).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: In the largest study to date, statistically significant associations were found between DPYD variants (DPYD*2A and D949V) and increased incidence of grade 3 or greater 5FU-AEs in patients treated with adjuvant 5-FU-based combination chemotherapy.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To analyze thymidylate synthase (TS) and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene polymorphism with respect to fluorouracil (FU) sensitivity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included a retrospective analysis of 88 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and a prospective trial with 51 patients also with measurable metastases. All patients were treated with FU and leucovorin. The analysis of gene polymorphism was performed on normal intestinal tissue and lymphocytes. RESULTS: The response rate was significantly higher in patients with TS 3R/3R or MTHFR 677 TT gene polymorphism compared with the other groups. The difference of response rate translated to a difference in time to progression. Similar results were observed in the retrospective analysis and the prospective confirmatory trial. CONCLUSION: The analysis of gene polymorphism allows delineation of a group of patients (30{\%}) with a response rate to a single drug of approximately 50{\%}. This information should be used in the design of tailored treatment.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relationship between 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) pharmacokinetics and toxicity following i.v. bolus administration has not been extensively studied. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and eighty-one patients on adjuvant therapy with 5-FU plus leucovorin for colorectal cancer were the study population. 5-FU pharmacokinetics was determined on day 2 of the first, third, and fifth cycles; type and the grade of adverse reactions were recorded on the next cycle. RESULTS: The 5-FU area under the curve (AUC) measured at the first cycle ranged between 146 and 1236 mg x min/l and was significantly correlated with drug dose, patients' body weight (BW) and gender, females having higher AUCs. These covariates explained only 23{\%} of AUC variability. AUC and age were the only covariates which discriminated between toxic (grade {\textgreater} or =2) and nontoxic cycles (grade {\textless}2), with an optimal AUC cut-off value of 596 mg x min/l. Such a correlation was lost during the next cycles following dose reduction because of toxicity in 80 patients. CONCLUSIONS: A method for calculating the initial 5-FU dose is proposed which takes into account patient BW, gender and a target AUC of 596 mg x min/l. Nevertheless, it appears that a substantial part of 5-FU toxicity is not linked to pharmacokinetic factors and dose adjustments must still be on the basis of careful clinical surveillance.},

abstract = {Genetic factors are known to affect the efficiency of therapy with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). At present, the only accepted molecular marker predictive of the response to anti-EGFR mAbs is the somatic mutation of KRAS and NRAS as a marker of resistance to anti-EGFR. However, only a fraction of KRAS wild-type patients benefit from that treatment. In this study, we show that the EGFR gene polymorphism rs1050171 defines, independently of RAS mutational status, a sub-population of 11 {\%} of patients with a better clinical outcome after anti-EGFR treatment. Median PFS for patients with the GG genotype was 10.17 months compared to 5.37 of those with AG + AA genotypes. Taken together, our findings could be used to better define CRC populations responding to anti-EGFR therapy. Further studies in larger independent cohorts are necessary to validate the present observation that a synonymous polymorphism in EGFR gene impacts on clinical responsiveness.},

abstract = {While 5-fluorouracil used as single agent in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer has an objective response rate around 20{\%}, the administration of combinations of irinotecan with 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid or oxaliplatin with 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid results in significantly increased response rates and improved survival. However, the side effects of systemic therapy such as myelotoxicity, neurotoxicity or gastrointestinal toxicity may lead to life-threatening complications and have a major impact on the quality of life of the patients. Therefore, biomarkers that would be instrumental in the choice of optimal type, combination and dose of drugs for an individual patient are urgently needed. The efficacy and toxicity of anticancer drugs in tumor cells is determined by the effective concentration in tumor cells, healthy tissues and by the presence and quantity of the drug targets. Enzymes active in drug metabolism and transport represent important determinants of the therapeutic outcome. The aim of this review was to summarize published data on associations of gene and protein expression, and genetic variability of putative biomarkers with response to therapy of colorectal cancer to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin/oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leukovorin/irinotecan regimens. Gaps in the knowledge identified by this review may aid the design of future research and clinical trials.},

abstract = {mTOR regulates several cellular processes that are critical for tumorigenesis. However, previous studies on the association of mTOR polymorphisms with predisposition to different cancer types are somewhat contradictory. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and updated meta-analysis of the available evidence regarding the relationship between mTOR single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and cancer risk. Up to November 2015, 23 original publications were identified covering 20 mTOR SNPs, of which seven SNPs (rs2536, rs2295080, rs1883965, rs1034528, rs17036508, rs3806317 and rs1064261) were included in the final meta-analysis. We estimated the summary odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) for mTOR polymorphisms and cancer risk, and used the model-free approach to investigate the biological effect of each polymorphism. Our meta-analysis found that rs1883965, rs1034528, and rs17036508 were correlated with increased cancer risk in the complete over-dominant model (rs1883965 GA versus GG/AA: fixed-effects OR=1.15, 95{\%} CI 1.02-1.29; rs1034528 GC versus GG/CC: fixed-effects OR=1.30, 95{\%} CI 1.13-1.48; rs17036508 TC versus CC/TT: fixed-effects OR=1.23, 95{\%} CI 1.06-1.43). Stratifying analyses by cancer type, we found that the rs2295080 G allele was associated with a significantly higher risk of acute leukemia in the recessive model (GG versus GT/TT: fixed-effects OR=2.08, 95{\%} CI 1.34-3.22) and a lower risk of genitourinary cancers in the dominant model (TG/GG versus TT: fixed-effects OR=0.77, 95{\%} CI 0.68-0.86). Interestingly, further expression analysis showed that homozygous variant genotype carriers of rs1883965, rs1034528 and rs17036508 had lower mTOR transcript levels, based on HapMap data.},

abstract = {Over 15,000 human tumor p53 mutations have been recorded in the scientific literature, including over 700 mutations in esophageal tumors. There are no data on p53 mutations in esophageal cancer patients from Iran yet; however, this country experiences one of the highest cancer mortality rates in the world for esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs). The causes of this high cancer burden in Iran remain obscure and do not appear to be related to tobacco and alcohol consumption, the two major risk factors identified in Europe and North America. Because molecular analysis of tumors can provide clues to endogenous or environmental factors contributing to high cancer risk, we examined 74 Iranian ESCCs for the presence of mutations in exons 5-8 of the p53 gene by PCR and direct sequencing. Forty-eight of the 74 tumors (65{\%}) had one or more p53 gene point mutations, including 5 patients with two or more mutations and one with a tandem mutation in codon 242. Surprisingly, over one-third of the 54 mutations we identified were transitions at CpG sites (20 of a total of 54 mutations, or 37{\%}), a class of mutation that is significantly less common (16{\%} of mutations) in the compilation of ESCC mutations from other countries (chi2 statistic, P {\textless} 0.0002), whereas transversions, which the literature shows to be common in ESCCs from non-Iranian patients, were infrequent in the tumors we examined here. Elevated levels of cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase were observed in 74 and 91{\%}, respectively, of tumors from Tehran as determined by immunohistochemistry, and high COX-2 expression correlated significantly with the presence of a p53 mutation in the tumor. Mediators of the inflammatory response in esophageal mucosa, perhaps in conjunction with specific dietary or cultural practices in Iran, may contribute importantly to the p53 mutation load in Iranian ESCC patients.},

abstract = {Irinotecan and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) are used to treat metastatic colorectal cancer. Irinotecan's active metabolite is inactivated by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1), which is deficient in Gilbert's syndrome. Irinotecan and metabolites are transported by P-glycoprotein, encoded by ABCB1. 5-FU targets folate metabolism through inhibition of thymidylate synthase (TYMS). Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) generates active folate necessary for haematopoiesis. We retrospectively genotyped 140 Swedish and Norwegian irinotecan and 5-FU-treated colorectal cancer patients from the Nordic VI clinical trial for selected variants of UGT1A1, ABCB1, TYMS and MTHFR. We found an increased risk of clinically relevant early toxicity in patients carrying the ABCB1 3435 T/T genotype, Odds ratio (OR)=3.79 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI)=1.09-13.2), and in patients carrying the UGT1A1(*)28/(*)28 genotype, OR=4.43 (95{\%} CI=1.30-15.2). Patients with UGT1A1(*)28/(*)28 had an especially high risk of neutropenia, OR=6.87 (95{\%} CI=1.70-27.7). Patients who had reacted with toxicity during the first two cycles were in total treated with fewer cycles (P{\textless}0.001), and less often responded to treatment (P{\textless}0.001). Genetic variation in ABCB1 was associated with both early toxicity and lower response to treatment. Carriers of the ABCB1 1236T-2677T-3435T haplotype responded to treatment less frequently (43 vs 67{\%}, P=0.027), and survived shorter time, OR=1.56 (95{\%} CI=1.01-2.45).},

abstract = {A common arginine to proline polymorphism is harboured at codon 72 of the human p53 gene. In this investigation, we found that fibroblasts and lymphocytes isolated from arginine allele homozygote centenarians and sexagenarians (Arg+) undergo an oxidative-stress-induced apoptosis at a higher extent than cells obtained from proline allele carriers (Pro+). At variance, the difference in apoptosis susceptibility between Arg+ and Pro+ is not significant when cells from 30-year-old people are studied. Further, we found that Arg+ and Pro+ cells from centenarians differ in the constitutive levels of p53 protein and p53/MDM2 complex, as well as in the levels of oxidative stress-induced p53/Bcl-xL complex and mitochondria-localised p53. Consistently, all these differences are less evident in cells from 30-year-old people. Finally, we investigated the in vivo functional relevance of the p53 codon 72 genotype in a group of old patients (66-99 years of age) affected by acute myocardial ischaemia, a clinical condition in which in vivo cell death occurs. We found that Arg+ patients show increased levels of Troponin I and CK-MB, two serum markers that correlate with the extent of the ischaemic damage in comparison to Pro+ patients. In conclusion, these data suggest that p53 codon 72 polymorphism contributes to a genetically determined variability in apoptotic susceptibility among old people, which has a potentially relevant role in the context of an age-related pathologic condition, such as myocardial ischaemia.},

abstract = {Protein p53 is the tumor suppressor involved in cell cycle control and apoptosis. There are several polymorphisms reported for p53 which can affect important regions involved in protein tumor suppressor activity. Amongst the polymorphisms described, R213R and 13949 g→a are rarely studied, with an estimate frequency not yet available for the Brazilian population. The purpose of this study was to investigate the genotype and allele frequencies and associations of these polymorphisms in a group of patients with altered esophageal tissue from South Brazil and compare with the frequency observed for a control population. A total of 35 patients for R213R and 45 for 13494 g→a polymorphisms analysis with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms diagnosed by upper digestive endoscopy and confirmed by biopsy were studied. For both groups, 100 controls were used for comparison. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was also analyzed for a selected group of patients where normal and affected tissue was available. There was one patient with Barrett's Esophagus (BE) showing LOH for R213R out of two heterozygous samples analyzed and two patients (esophagitis and BE) for 13494 g→a polymorphism. We also aimed to build a haplotype for both polymorphisms collectively analyzed with R27P polymorphism, previously reported by our group. There were no significant differences in allele and genotype distribution between patients and controls. Although using esophagitis, intestinal metaplasia of the cardia and BE samples, all non-neoplastic lesions, we can conclude that these sites do not represent genetic susceptibility markers for the development and early progression of GERD to BE and esophageal cancer. Additional studies are required in order to investigate other determiners of early premalignant lesions known to predispose to esophageal cancer.},

abstract = {This study aims at establishing relationships between genetic and non-genetic factors of variation of the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan and its metabolites; and also at establishing relationships between the pharmacokinetic or metabolic parameters and the efficacy and toxicity of irinotecan. We included 49 patients treated for metastatic colorectal cancer with a combination of 5-fluorouracil and irinotecan; a polymorphism in the UGT1A1 gene (TA repeat in the TATA box) and one in the CES2 gene promoter (830C{\textgreater}G) were studied as potential markers for SN-38 glucuronidation and irinotecan activation, respectively; and the potential activity of CYP3A4 was estimated from cortisol biotransformation into 6beta-hydroxycortisol. No pharmacokinetic parameter was directly predictive of clinical outcome or toxicity. The AUCs of three important metabolites of irinotecan, SN-38, SN-38 glucuronide and APC, were tentatively correlated with patients' pretreatment biological parameters related to drug metabolism (plasma creatinine, bilirubin and liver enzymes, and blood leukocytes). SN-38 AUC was significantly correlated with blood leukocytes number and SN-38G AUC was significantly correlated with plasma creatinine, whereas APC AUC was significantly correlated with plasma liver enzymes. The relative extent of irinotecan activation was inversely correlated with SN-38 glucuronidation. The TATA box polymorphism of UGT1A1 was significantly associated with plasma bilirubin levels and behaved as a significant predictor for neutropoenia. The level of cortisol 6beta-hydroxylation predicted for the occurrence of diarrhoea. All these observations may improve the routine use of irinotecan in colorectal cancer patients. UGT1A1 genotyping plus cortisol 6beta-hydroxylation determination could help to determine the optimal dose of irinotecan.},

abstract = {Irinotecan unexpectedly causes severe toxicity of leukopenia or diarrhea. Irinotecan is metabolized to form active SN-38, which is further conjugated and detoxified by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 enzyme. Genetic polymorphisms of the UGT1A1 would affect an interindividual variation of the toxicity by irinotecan via the alternation of bioavailability of SN-38. In this case-control study, retrospective review of clinical records and determination of UGT1A1 polymorphisms were performed to investigate whether a patient with the variant UGT1A1 genotypes would be at higher risk for severe toxicity by irinotecan. All patients previously received irinotecan against cancer in university hospitals, cancer centers, or large urban hospitals in Japan. We identified 26 patients who experienced severe toxicity and 92 patients who did not. The relationship was studied between the multiple variant genotypes (UGT1A1*28 in the promoter and UGT1A1*6, UGT1A1*27, UGT1A1*29, and UGT1A1*7 in the coding region) and the severe toxicity of grade 4 leukopenia ({\textless} or =0.9 x 10(9)/liter) and/or grade 3 (watery for 5 days or more) or grade 4 (hemorrhagic or dehydration) diarrhea. Of the 26 patients with the severe toxicity, the genotypes of UGT1A1*28 were homozygous in 4 (15{\%}) and heterozygous in 8 (31{\%}), whereas 3 (3{\%}) homozygous and 10 (11{\%}) heterozygous were found among the 92 patients without the severe toxicity. Multivariate analysis suggested that the genotype either heterozygous or homozygous for UGT1A1*28 would be a significant risk factor for severe toxicity by irinotecan (P {\textless} 0.001; odds ratio, 7.23; 95{\%} confidence interval, 2.52-22.3). All 3 patients heterozygous for UGT1A1*27 encountered severe toxicity. No statistical association of UGT1A1*6 with the occurrence of severe toxicity was observed. None had UGT1A1*29 or UGT1A1*7. We suggest that determination of the UGT1A1 genotypes might be clinically useful for predicting severe toxicity by irinotecan in cancer patients. This research warrants a prospective trial to corroborate the usefulness of gene diagnosis of UGT1A1 polymorphisms prior tb irinotecan chemotherapy.},

A total of 182 patients with NIS, 103 patients with chronic hepatitis C, and 118 control subjects were enrolled in the study. Of the 35 SNPs studied, 3 were in IFN-[alpha] receptor (IFNAR-1), 10 in IFN-[alpha]/[beta] receptor (IFNAR-2), 9 in Statl, 5 in Stat2, and 8 in IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1). Compared to controls, Statl gene polymorphisms were significantly more frequent in NIS patients (rs{\#} 2066802 OR = 7.46, 95{\%} CI = 2.22-25.10; rs{\#} 1547550 OR = 1.69, 95{\%} CI = 1.01-2.81) and in HCV patients (rs{\#} 2066802 OR = 5.95, 95{\%} CI = 1.55-22.81; rs{\#} 1547550 OR = 2.30, 95{\%} CI = 1.24-4.24). Also one IRF-1 gene SNP was associated with NIS (rs{\#} 2070721 OR = 2.05, 95{\%} CI = 1.03-4.09), and four IRF-1 gene SNPs were associated with HCV infection (rs{\#}2070721 OR = 2.59, 95{\%} CI = 1.23-5.43; rs{\#} 2070723 OR = 4.8, 95{\%} CI = 1.26-18.20; rs{\#} 2070728 OR = 9.81, 95{\%} CI = 1.2179.4; rs{\#} 2070729 OR = 3.6, 95{\%} CI = 1.23-10.48; rs{\#} 839 OR = 4.67, 95{\%}CI = 1.29-16.87). Characteristic nucleotide combinations on single chromosomes (haplotype) generated block structures, including SNPs, that differed between patients and controls. Using a permutation test to detect differences in haplotype distribution between groups, the CCATTGA and the CCGAA haplotypes in the IRF-1 gene were more frequent in NIS (p = 0.03) and in HCV patients (p = 0.001) than in controls. In conclusion, our data show that genetic variants in the IRF-1 and Statl genes of the IFN pathway are associated with NIS and HCV infection.},

Toxicity was documented according to World Health Organization grades. DPYD, TYMS, and MTHFR genotypes were determined, and DPYD was resequenced in patients with severe toxicity.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Grade 3 to 4 toxicity occurred in 16.1{\%} of patients. The sensitivity of DPYD*2A genotyping for overall toxicity was 5.5{\%} (95{\%}CI, 0.02 to 0.11), with a positive predictive value of 0.46 (95{\%} CI, 0.19 to 0.75; P = .01). Inclusion of additional DPYD variants improved prediction only marginally. Analysis according to toxicity type revealed significant association of DPYD with mucositis and leukopenia, whereas TYMS was associated with diarrhea. Genotype, female sex, mode of FU administration, and modulation by folinic acid were identified as independent risk factors by multivariable analysis. A previously unrecognized significant interaction was found between sex and DPYD, which resulted in an odds ratio for toxicity of 41.8 for male patients (95{\%} CI, 9.2 to 190; P {\textless} .0001) but only 1.33 (95{\%} CI, 0.34 to 5.2) in female patients. Homozygosity for the TYMS enhancer region double repeat allele increased risk for toxicity 1.6-fold (95{\%} CI, 1.08 to 2.22; P = .02).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: DPYD, TYMS, and MTHFR play a limited role for FU related toxicity but a pronounced DPYD gene/sex-interaction increases prediction rate for male patients. Toxicity risk assessment should include sex, mode of administration, and folinic acid as additional predictive factors.},

Nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect EGFR exon 20 mutations of patients with NSCLC after chemotherapy. The same is being analyzed with patients' characteristics.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Peripheral blood samples were collected from 273 patients with NSCLC, including 143 with adenocarcinoma (ADC) and 130 with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), after chemotherapy. DNA was extracted from whole blood for nested PCR amplification and purification. Sequencing was carried out in an automated 3730 sequencer, followed by analysis of EGFR exon 20 mutations from nested PCR products.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The mutations of EGFR exon 20 were mainly point mutations in rs1050171 (c.2361A{\textgreater}G) and rs56183713 (c.2457G{\textgreater}A). The point mutation was 28.21{\%}, 28.46{\%}, and 27.97{\%} in patients with NSCLC, ADC and SCC, respectively. Men had an equivalent mutation (27.18{\%}) to women (30.77{\%}). The mutation in smokers and nonsmokers was 27.68{\%} and 29.17{\%}, respectively. In unselected patients, there was no correlation between EGFR exon 20 mutations and patients' characteristics of age, gender, smoking history, histologic type, or tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system.

abstract = {PURPOSE: The objective is to investigate whether polymorphisms with putative influence on fluorouracil/oxaliplatin activity are associated with clinical outcomes of patients with advanced colorectal cancer treated with first-line oxaliplatin, folinic acid, and fluorouracil palliative chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients were prospectively enrolled onto medical oncology units in Central Italy. Patients were required to have cytologically/histologically confirmed metastatic disease with at least one measurable lesion. Peripheral blood samples were used for genotyping 12 polymorphisms in thymidylate synthase, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, xeroderma pigmentosum group D (XPD), excision repair cross complementing group 1 (ERCC1), x-ray cross complementing group 1, x-ray cross complementing protein 3, glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) genes. The primary end point of the study was to investigate the association between genotypes and progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: In 166 patients, ERCC1-118 T/T, XPD-751 A/C, and XPD-751 C/C genotypes were independently associated with adverse PFS. The presence of two risk genotypes (ERCC1-118 T/T combined with either XPD-751 A/C or XPD-751 C/C) occurred in 50 patients (31{\%}). This profiling showed an independent role for unfavorable PFS with a hazard ratio of 2.84{\%} and 95{\%} CI of 1.47 to 5.45 (P = .002). Neurotoxicity was significantly associated with GSTP1-105 A/G. Carriers of the GSTP1-105 G/G genotype were more prone to suffer from grade 3 neurotoxicity than carriers of GSTP1-105 A/G and GSTP1-105 A/A genotypes. CONCLUSION: A pharmacogenetic approach may be an innovative strategy for optimizing palliative chemotherapy in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. These findings deserve confirmation in additional prospective studies.},

We investigated 22 DPYD gene SNPs, their respective incidence, their link with grade 3 to 4 toxic side effects, and their management in practice: 9 were looked for in 487 patients, whereas 13 others were investigated in 171 patients.$\backslash$nPATIENTS AND METHODS: SNPs were detected before 5-FU-based treatment in WBC using a Pyrosequencing method. Close clinical and biological follow-up was done.$\backslash$nRESULTS: Five different SNPs were found in 187 patients (IVS14 + 1G{\textgreater}A, 2846A{\textgreater}T, 1679T{\textgreater}G, 85T{\textgreater}C, -1590T{\textgreater}C). Three hundred patients had no SNP. Forty-four patients had grade 3 to 4 toxic side effects in either the first or second cycle. Sixty percent of patients with either IVS14 + 1G{\textgreater}A or 2846A{\textgreater}T SNPs and the only patient with 1679T{\textgreater}G SNP experienced early grade 3 to 4 toxicity, compared with 0{\%}, 5.5{\%}, and 15{\%} of those with either -1590T{\textgreater}C, 85T{\textgreater}C SNP, or no SNP, respectively. In cases with grade 3 to 4 toxicity, treatment either had to be quickly stopped, or could be safely continued with an individual dose adjustment. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the detection of these three major SNPs as toxicity predictive factors were 0.31, 0.98, and 0.62 and 0.94, respectively.$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Pretreatment detection of three DPYD SNPs could help to avoid severe toxic side effects. This approach is suitable for clinical practice and should be compared or combined with pharmacologic approaches. In the case of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency, 5-FU administration often can be safely continued with an individual dose adjustment.},

abstract = {Background: Individuals with Li-Fraumeni syndrome have a high lifetime risk of developing cancer. We assessed the feasibility and potential clinical effect of a comprehensive surveillance protocol in asymptomatic TP53 mutation carriers in families with this syndrome. Methods: We implemented a clinical surveillance protocol, using frequent biochemical and imaging studies, for asymptomatic TP53 mutation carriers on Jan 1, 2004, and did a prospective observational study of members of eight families with Li-Fraumeni syndrome who either chose to undergo surveillance or chose not to undergo surveillance. The primary outcome measure was detection of new cancers. The secondary outcome measure was overall survival. Findings: As of Nov 1, 2010, 33 TP53 mutation carriers were identified, 18 of whom underwent surveillance. The surveillance protocol detected ten asymptomatic tumours in seven patients, including small, high-grade tumours and low-grade or premalignant tumours. All seven mutation carriers were alive after a median follow-up of 24 months (IQR 22-65 months). 12 high-grade, high-stage tumours developed in 10 individuals in the non-surveillance group, two of whom (20{\%}) were alive at the end of follow-up (p=0{\textperiodcentered}0417 for comparison with survival in the surveillance group). 3-year overall survival was 100{\%} in the surveillance group and 21{\%} (95{\%} CI 4-48{\%}) in the non-surveillance group (p=0{\textperiodcentered}0155). Interpretation: Our findings show the feasibility of a clinical surveillance protocol for the detection of asymptomatic neoplasms in individuals with germline TP53 mutations. This strategy offers a management option for affected individuals, and its benefits lend support to the use of early genetic testing of at-risk individuals and families.

In this study, we present a computational based screening and molecular dynamic simulation of breast cancer associated deleterious non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms in TP53. We have predicted three deleterious coding non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms rs11540654 (R110P), rs17849781 (P278A) and rs28934874 (P151T) in TP53 with a phenotype in breast tumors using computational tools SIFT, Polyphen-2 and MutDB.

Our purpose was to study the prognostic value of p53 alterations and to determine whether some specific mutation type in the p53 gene could be associated with poor clinical evolution in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. To this end, we studied 81 resected primary NSCLCs in order to detect p53 alterations. p53 protein accumulation was analysed using immunohistochemistry methods; p53 gene mutations in exons 5-9 were studied using polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism and sequencing techniques. p53 protein was immunodetected in 46.9{\%} of lung carcinomas and 44.7{\%} of p53-immunopositive tumours showed p53 mutations. Survival analysis was performed on 62 patients. No survival differences were found for patients with or without p53 immunopositivity. A shorter survival was found in patients with underlying p53 gene mutations, mainly in patients with squamous cell lung tumours; the worst prognosis was found when mutations were located in exon 5 (P = 0.007). In conclusion, the location of p53 mutations might be considered as a prognostic indicator for the evaluation of poor clinical evolution in NSCLC patients.},

abstract = {Glucuronidation catalyzed by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) is one of the most important mechanisms for host defense against xenobiotics and endobiotics. Although genetic polymorphisms of several UGT1A isoforms have been reported separately, the haplotypes in all functional exons have not been identified, and little information is available regarding single nucleotide polymorphisms in Koreans. We analyzed genetic polymorphisms in all functional exons of the UGT1A locus by direct sequencing of genomic DNA from 50 healthy Korean subjects, and their haplotypes were inferred from genotype data using an expectation-maximization algorithm. We identified 67 polymorphisms, including three novel single nucleotide polymorphisms, 233C{\textgreater}T in UGT1A1 (T78M), 292C{\textgreater}T in 1A4 (Q98Stop), and 701T{\textgreater}C in 1A7 (I234T). Two amino acid substitutions, 1A4 Q98Stop and 1A7 I234T, were each associated with a decrease of enzymatic activity, whereas UGT1A1 T78M had no significant influence on catalytic function. The frequencies of the known variants in Koreans differed significantly from those reported in other ethnic groups. Haplotype analysis was performed within the polymorphisms in each UGT1A isoform as well as across the isoforms. Based on strong linkage disequilibrium within UGT1A7, between 1A5 and 1A4, and within 1A3, the complex was divided into three blocks, Block 7, Block 5/4, and Block 3. The haplotypes for each block were subsequently determined, revealing a profile that differed from those of other ethnic groups. These results suggest that genetic polymorphisms of the UGT1A locus differ between Koreans and other ethnic populations. Such differences should be considered in pharmacogenetic studies.},

abstract = {Glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) participates in detoxification of potentially genotoxic compounds that may alter the efficacy and toxicity of platinum-based chemotherapy. We analyzed the influence of I105V polymorphism of GSTP1 on clinico-pathological features and outcomes in 166 Chinese patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma who had been treated with first-line FOLFOX-4. Combined analysis of GSTP1 I105V, ERCC1-118, and XPD-751 polymorphisms was also conducted. The results showed that, in comparison with Caucasian populations, a remarkably lower prevalence of Val105 allele variants was noted (24.7{\%}). Patients with Val105 allele variants had a higher response to FOLFOX-4 (56.1{\%}vs 37.6{\%}, P = 0.04), and a longer progression-free (P {\textless} 0.01) as well as overall (P {\textless} 0.01) survival. By adjusted analysis, this polymorphism was identified as an independent prognostic factor (P = 0.01). In combined analysis, patients without any risk genotype, including GSTP1-105 Ile/Ile, ERCC1-118 C/T or T/T, and XPD-751 Lys/Gln, had significantly longer progression-free and overall survivals (P {\textless} 0.01). In addition, patients with Val105 allele variants had a higher incidence of grade 3/4 cumulative neuropathy after different cycles of treatment. These data suggest that Asian populations have a lower prevalence of I105V polymorphism in GSTP1. I105V polymorphism in GSTP1, by reducing its enzymatic activity and consequential detoxification to oxaliplatin, could be a key determinant for a better outcome, but more neurotoxicity, to FOLFOX-4 treatment.},

The coding region of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase gene (DPYD) was sequenced in 45 cases with grade 3 or more capecitabine-related toxicity and in 100 randomly selected controls (cohort). Most discriminating (P {\textless} 0.1) or frequently occurring ({\textgreater}1{\%}) nonsynonymous SNPs were analyzed in all 568 patients. SNPs and haplotypes were associated with toxicity, capecitabine dose modifications, and survival.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A total of 29 SNPs were detected in the case-cohort analysis, of which 8 were analyzed in all 568 patients. Of the patients polymorphic for DPYD IVS14+1G{\textgreater}A, 2846A{\textgreater}T, and 1236G{\textgreater}A, 71{\%} (5 of 7), 63{\%} (5 of 8), and 50{\%} (14 of 28) developed grade 3 to 4 diarrhea, respectively, compared with 24{\%} in the overall population. All patients polymorphic for IVS14+1G{\textgreater}A developed any grade 3 to 4 toxicity, including one possibly capecitabine-related death. Because of toxicity, a mean capecitabine dose reduction of 50{\%} was applied in IVS14+1G{\textgreater}A and 25{\%} in 2846A{\textgreater}T variant allele carriers. Patients were categorized into six haplotype groups: one predicted for reduced (10{\%}), and two for increased risks (41{\%} and 33{\%}) for severe diarrhea. Individual SNPs were not associated with overall survival, whereas one haplotype was associated with overall survival [HR (95{\%} CI) = 0.57 (0.35-0.95)].$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: DPYD IVS14+1G{\textgreater}A and 2846A{\textgreater}T predict for severe toxicity to capecitabine, for which patients require dose reductions.

abstract = {PURPOSE: Gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) result in unbalanced STAT signaling and cause immune dysregulation and immunodeficiency. The latter is often characterized by the susceptibility to recurrent Candida infections, resulting in the clinical picture of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC). This study aims to assess the frequency of GOF STAT1 mutations in a large international cohort of CMC patients.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: STAT1 was sequenced in genomic DNA from 57 CMC patients and 35 healthy family members. The functional relevance of nine different STAT1 variants was shown by flow cytometric analysis of STAT1 phosphorylation in patients' peripheral blood cells (PBMC) after stimulation with interferon (IFN)-$\alpha$, IFN-$\gamma$ or interleukin-27 respectively. Extended clinical data sets were collected and summarized for 26 patients.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Heterozygous mutations within STAT1 were identified in 35 of 57 CMC patients (61 {\%}). Out of 39 familial cases from 11 families, 26 patients (67 {\%}) from 9 families and out of 18 sporadic cases, 9 patients (50 {\%}) were shown to have heterozygous mutations within STAT1. Thirteen distinct STAT1 mutations are reported in this paper. Eight of these mutations are known to cause CMC (p.M202V, p.A267V, p.R274W, p.R274Q, p.T385M, p.K388E, p.N397D, and p.F404Y). However, five STAT1 variants (p.F172L, p.Y287D, p.P293S, p.T385K and p.S466R) have not been reported before in CMC patients.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: STAT1 mutations are frequently observed in patients suffering from CMC. Thus, sequence analysis of STAT1 in CMC patients is advised. Measurement of IFN- or IL-induced STAT1 phosphorylation in PBMC provides a fast and reliable diagnostic tool and should be carried out in addition to genetic testing.},

abstract = {About 40{\%} of French Canadian breast and/or ovarian cancer families harbor germline BRCA1 or BRCA1 mutations where common mutations account for about 84{\%} of all mutations identified in cancer families. Within a series of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative families, a germline TP53 13398 G{\textgreater}A (Arg213Gln) mutation was identified, which was selected for mutation analysis in this gene because of a family history consistent with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). Given the founder effects in this population, the 13398 G{\textgreater}A mutation was screened in series of 52 BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative cancer families, and a mutation-positive family was identified. However, pedigree inspection and expansion of mutation-positive families with the same mutation revealed that they were closely related to each other. To further characterize the contribution of TP53 in cancer families, mutation analysis was performed in the remaining BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative cancer families. Thirty sequence variants were identified, the majority of which occur in intronic sequences and are not predicted to affect the functionality of TP53. However, the 14538 G{\textgreater}A (Arg290His) mutation was identified in a family which did not exhibit features consistent with LFS or Li-Fraumeni-like (LFL) syndrome. Neither of the TP53 mutations was detected in 381 French Canadian women with breast cancer diagnosed before 50 years of age not selected for family history of cancer. In all, germline TP53 mutations were identified in two of 52 (3.8{\%}) cancer families, suggesting that TP53 is not a major contributor to BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative breast and/or ovarian cancer families of French Canadian descent.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Severe toxicity is commonly observed in cancer patients receiving irinotecan. UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) catalyzes the glucuronidation of the active metabolite SN-38. This study prospectively evaluated the association between the prevalence of severe toxicity and UGT1A1 genetic variation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-six cancer patients with advanced disease refractory to other treatments received irinotecan 350 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks. Toxicity and pharmacokinetic data were measured during cycle 1. UGT1A1 variants (-3279G{\textgreater}T, -3156G{\textgreater}A, promoter TA indel, 211G{\textgreater}A, 686C{\textgreater}A) were genotyped. RESULTS: The prevalence of grade 4 neutropenia was 9.5{\%}. Grade 4 neutropenia was much more common in patients with the TA indel 7/7 genotype (3 of 6 patients; 50{\%}) compared with 6/7 (3 of 24 patients; 12.5{\%}) and 6/6 (0 of 29 patients; 0{\%}) (P =.001). The TA indel genotype was significantly associated with the absolute neutrophil count nadir (7/7 {\textless} 6/7 {\textless} 6/6, P =.02). The relative risk of grade 4 neutropenia was 9.3 (95{\%} CI, 2.4 to 36.4) for the 7/7 patients versus the rest of the patients. Pretreatment total bilirubin levels (mean +/- standard deviation) were significantly higher in patients with grade 4 neutropenia (0.83 +/- 0.08 mg/dL) compared to those without grade 4 neutropenia (0.47 +/- 0.03 mg/dL; P {\textless}.001). The -3156G{\textgreater}A variant seemed to distinguish different phenotypes of total bilirubin within the TA indel genotypes. The -3156 genotype and the SN-38 area under the concentration versus time curve were significant predictors of ln(absolute neutrophil count nadir; r(2) = 0.51). CONCLUSION: UGT1A1 genotype and total bilirubin levels are strongly associated with severe neutropenia, and could be used to identify cancer patients predisposed to the severe toxicity of irinotecan. The hypothesis that the -3156G{\textgreater}A variant is a better predictor of UGT1A1 status than the previously reported TA indel requires further testing.},

abstract = {A pharmacogenetic syndrome caused by molecular defects in the dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase gene (DPYD ) results in partial to complete loss of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) enzyme activity with patients exhibiting life-threatening toxicity following administration of routine doses of 5-fluorouracil. To date, more than 19 reported mutations have been putatively associated with DPD deficiency with 16 occurring within the open reading frame of the cDNA. The purpose of this study was to examine the conservation of functional domains (including the uracil, flavine adenine dinucleotide and NADPH binding sites) across three phyla (Chordata, Arthropoda and Nematoda) and the conservation of regions corresponding to the previously reported mutations. Comparative analysis of the uracil and NADPH binding sites in mammals and invertebrates demonstrated 100{\%} amino acid identity between mammals and Drosophila melanogaster. Caenorhabditis elegans demonstrated 89{\%} and 88{\%} identity in these domains, respectively. The mammalian sequences demonstrated 100{\%} identity in two iron sulphur motifs (amino acids 953-964 and 986-997) with significant conservation in D. melanogaster (92{\%} and 92{\%} identity, respectively) and C. elegans (100{\%} and 92{\%} identity, respectively). Comparative amino acid analysis revealed non-conservation in the loci of four DPYD mutations [DPYD*12 (R21Q), DPYD*5 (I543V), DPYD*6 (V732I), DPYD*9A (C29R)]. Seven mutations occurred in highly conserved regions [M166V, DPYD*8 (R235W), DPYD*11 (V335l), DPYD*4 (S534N), DPYD*9B (R886H), D949V, DPYD*10 (V995F)]. In summary, this comparative analysis identified conserved regions which may be critical to enzyme structure and/or function. The conservation of loci where DPYD mutations occur was also examined to evaluate their functional significance on DPD enzyme activity. These data should prove useful in the evaluation of newly discovered mutations in the DPYD gene.},

A synonymous polymorphism (rs1050171, p.Q787Q) was shown to be associated with improved overall survival (OS) in colorectal cancer patients. As data in NSCLC are limited, we retrospectively ana- lyzed associations of p.Q787Q with clinicopathological parameters including clinical response and outcome in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) who received tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. Of 642 ADC patients whose tumors were profiled by next generation sequencing, 102 (15.9{\%}) carried EGFR mutations targetable by TKIs (30.4{\%} male patients, median age 65.1 y, 19.6{\%} smokers with 12.8 median pack years). Seventy-nine patients (77.5{\%}) received TKI therapy either as a first- or second-line therapy. Of the 102 EGFR-mutant tumors, 72 (70.6{\%}) exhibited the p.Q787Q polymorphism and another 12 (11.8{\%}) cases with p.Q787Q harbored an additional TKI insensitive mutation (p.T790M).

Its controlled inhibition has become an adjunct target for cancer therapy, since the enzyme is also responsible for the rapid breakdown of the chemotherapeutic drug 5-fluorouracil. The crystal structure of the homodimeric pig liver enzyme (2x 111 kDa) determined at 1.9 A resolution reveals a highly modular subunit organization, consisting of five domains with different folds. Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase contains two FAD, two FMN and eight [4Fe-4S] clusters, arranged in two electron transfer chains that pass the dimer interface twice. Two of the Fe-S clusters show a hitherto unobserved coordination involving a glutamine residue. The ternary complex of an inactive mutant of the enzyme with bound NADPH and 5-fluorouracil reveals the architecture of the substrate-binding sites and residues responsible for recognition and binding of the drug.},

METHODS: A luciferase system was used to investigate the function of the 6 bp/1494 polymorphism in vitro. A group of 43 patients with colorectal carcinoma were evaluated for the 6 bp/1494 polymorphism and for intratumoral TS mRNA levels in vivo. RESULTS: The 3'UTR of TS containing the +6 bp polymorphism resulted in an approximate 35{\%} decrease in luciferase activity and mRNA levels, while the TS-3'UTR bearing the -6 bp deletion resulted in an approximate 70{\%} decrease in luciferase activity and mRNA levels. The TS-3'UTR construct containing the -6 bp/1494 deletion also had a higher rate of message degradation compared to the +6 bp/1494 construct. Individuals homozygous for the insertion (+6 bp/+6 bp) had significantly higher TS mRNA levels compared to individuals that were homozygous for the deletion (-6 bp/-6 bp) (P {\textless} 0.007). We determined the frequency of the -6 bp/1494 deletion polymorphism to be 41{\%} in non-Hispanic whites, 26{\%} in Hispanic whites, 52{\%} in African-Americans and 76{\%} in Singapore Chinese. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the -6 bp/1494 deletion polymorphism in the 3'UTR of TS is associated with decreased mRNA stability in vitro and lower intratumoral TS expression in vivo. Further, the 6 bp/1494 polymorphism varies greatly within different ethnic populations and is in linkage disequilibrium with the TS 5' tandem repeat enhancer polymorphism. Taken together, these data suggest that the 6 bp/1494 polymorphism may be a useful screening tool in predicting TS mRNA expression.},

To evaluate the importance of this specific type of inborn error of pyrimidine metabolism in the etiology of 5FU toxicity, an analysis of the DPD activity, the DPD gene, and the clinical presentation of patients suffering from severe toxicity after the administration of 5FU was performed. Our study demonstrated that in 59{\%} of the cases, a decreased DPD activity could be detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. It was observed that 55{\%} of patients with a decreased DPD activity suffered from grade IV neutropenia compared with 13{\%} of patients with a normal DPD activity (P = 0.01). Furthermore, the onset of toxicity occurred, on average, twice as fast in patients with low DPD activity as compared with patients with a normal DPD activity (10.0 +/- 7.6 versus 19.1 +/- 15.3 days; P {\textless} 0.05). Analysis of the DPD gene of 14 patients with a reduced DPD activity revealed the presence of mutations in 11 of 14 patients, with the splice site mutation IVS14+1G--{\textgreater}A being the most abundant one (6 of 14 patients; 43{\%}). Two novel missense mutations 496A--{\textgreater}G (M166V) and 2846A--{\textgreater}T (D949V) were detected in exon 6 and exon 22, respectively.

abstract = {5-Fluorouracil is among the most widely used anticancer drug, but a fraction of treated patients develop severe toxicity, with potentially lethal injuries. The predictive power of the available pretreatment assays, used to identify patients at risk of severe toxicity, needs improvements. This study aimed to correlate a phenotypic marker of 5-fluorouracil metabolism (the individual degradation rate of 5-fluorouracil-5-FUDR) with 15 functional polymorphisms in the dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase gene (DPYD). Single SNP (single-nucleotide polymorphism) analysis revealed that the SNPs rs1801160, rs1801265, rs2297595 and rs3918290 (splice site variant IVS14+1G{\textgreater}A) were significantly associated with a decreased value of 5-FUDR, and the rs3918290 causing the larger decrease. Multi-SNP analysis showed that a three-SNP haplotype (Hap7) involving rs1801160, rs1801265 and rs2297595 causes a marked decrease in 5-FUDR, comparable to that caused by the splice site variant rs3918290, which is the main pharmacogenetic marker associated with severe fluorouracil toxicity. The similar effect played by Hap7 and by the splice site variant rs3918290 upon individual 5-FUDR suggests that Hap7 could also represent a similar determinant of fluorouracil toxicity. Haplotype assessment could improve the predictive value of DPYD genetic markers aimed at the pre-emptive identification of patients at risk of severe 5-fluorouracil toxicity.The Pharmacogenomics Journal advance online publication, 28 July 2015; doi:10.1038/tpj.2015.56.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Variants in numerous genes are thought to affect the success or failure of cancer chemotherapy. Interindividual variability can result from genes involved in drug metabolism and transport, drug targets (receptors, enzymes, etc), and proteins relevant to cell survival (e.g., cell cycle, DNA repair, and apoptosis). The purpose of the current study is to establish a flexible, cost effective,high-throughput genotyping platform for candidate genes involved in chemo resistance and -sensitivity, and treatment outcomes. METHODS: We have adopted SNPlex for genotyping 432 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)in 160 candidate genes implicated in response to anticancer chemotherapy. RESULTS: The genotyping panels were applied to 39 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia undergoing flavopiridol chemotherapy, and 90 patients with colorectal cancer. 408 SNPs (94{\%})produced successful genotyping results. Additional genotyping methods were established for polymorphisms undetectable by SNPlex, including multiplexed SNaPshot for CYP2D6 SNPs, andPCR amplification with fluorescently labeled primers for the UGT1A1 promoter (TA)nTAA repeat polymorphism. CONCLUSION: This genotyping panel is useful for supporting clinical anticancer drug trials to identify polymorphisms that contribute to interindividual variability in drug response. Availability of population genetic data across multiple studies has the potential to yield genetic biomarkers for optimizing anticancer therapy.},

abstract = {The potential clinical utility of genetic markers associated with response to fluoropyrimidine treatment in colorectal cancer patients remains controversial despite extensive study. Our aim was to test the clinical validity of both novel and previously identified markers of adverse events in a broad clinical setting. We have conducted an observational pharmacogenetic study of early adverse events in a cohort study of 254 colorectal cancer patients treated with 5-fluorouracil or capecitabine. Sixteen variants of nine key folate (pharmacodynamic) and drug metabolising (pharmacokinetic) enzymes have been analysed as individual markers and/or signatures of markers. We found a significant association between TYMP S471L (rs11479) and early dose modifications and/or severe adverse events (adjusted OR = 2.02 [1.03; 4.00], p = 0.042, adjusted OR = 2.70 [1.23; 5.92], p = 0.01 respectively). There was also a significant association between these phenotypes and a signature of DPYD mutations (Adjusted OR = 3.96 [1.17; 13.33], p = 0.03, adjusted OR = 6.76 [1.99; 22.96], p = 0.002 respectively). We did not identify any significant associations between the individual candidate pharmacodynamic markers and toxicity. If a predictive test for early adverse events analysed the TYMP and DPYD variants as a signature, the sensitivity would be 45.5 {\%}, with a positive predictive value of just 33.9 {\%} and thus poor clinical validity. Most studies to date have been under-powered to consider multiple pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variants simultaneously but this and similar individualised data sets could be pooled in meta-analyses to resolve uncertainties about the potential clinical utility of these markers.},

abstract = {Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) controls intracellular CH2FH4 concentrations (required for optimal fluoropyrimidine efficacy) by irreversibly converting CH2FH4 into 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. MTHFR 677C{\textgreater}T and 1298A{\textgreater}C polymorphisms are linked to altered enzyme activity. Thus, mutated MTHFR tumours should, in theory, be more sensitive to 5-fluorouracil (5FU) than wild-type tumours. MTHFR polymorphisms in position 677 and 1298 were analysed in 98 colorectal cancer patients with unresectable liver metastases (57 men, 41 women, mean age 64 years) receiving 5FU-folinic acid. 677C{\textgreater}T and 1298A{\textgreater}C genotypes were determined simultaneously by melting curve analyses on liver metastases. 677C{\textgreater}T genotype distribution was 46.9{\%} wt/wt, 34.7{\%} wt/mut and 18.4{\%} mut/mut; that of 1298A{\textgreater}C was 52.0{\%} wt/wt, 35.7{\%} wt/mut and 12.3{\%} mut/mut. The response rate was not related to 1298A{\textgreater}C genotype but was significantly linked to 677C{\textgreater}T genotype (response rate: 40{\%}, 21{\%} and 56{\%} in wt/wt, wt/mut and mut/mut, respectively; P = 0.040), with an increased response rate in mut/mut tumours relative to wt/wt (odds ratio = 1.88). Thymidylate synthase activity measured in metastases was a significant predictor of 5FU responsiveness and the addition of the 677C{\textgreater}T genotype improved model prediction. MTHFR 1298A{\textgreater}C polymorphism was significantly linked to specific survival, with homozygous mutated patients having the worst prognosis (P = 0.009, relative risk = 2.48 in mut/mut versus wt/wt). MTHFR 1298A{\textgreater}C genotype remained a significant predictor in a multivariate analysis including metastasis characteristics. The results suggest that MTHFR genotypes are relevant and independent factors of patient outcome in 5FU-based treatment of advanced colorectal cancer.},

abstract = {Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) is the initial and rate-limiting enzyme of the uracil catabolic pathway, being critically important for inactivation of the commonly prescribed anti-cancer drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). DPD impairment leads to increased exposure to 5-FU and, in turn, increased anabolism of 5-FU to cytotoxic nucleotides, resulting in more severe clinical adverse effects. Numerous variants within the gene coding for DPD, DPYD, have been described, although only a few have been demonstrated to reduce DPD enzyme activity. To identify DPYD variants that alter enzyme function, we expressed 80 protein-coding variants in an isogenic mammalian system and measured their capacities to convert 5-FU to dihydro-fluorouracil, the product of DPD catabolism. The M166V, E828K, K861R, and P1023T variants exhibited significantly higher enzyme activity than wild-type DPD (120{\%}, P = 0.025; 116{\%}, P = 0.049; 130{\%}, P = 0.0077; 138{\%}, P = 0.048, respectively). Consistent with clinical association studies of 5-FU toxicity, the D949V substitution reduced enzyme activity by 41{\%} (P = 0.0031). Enzyme activity was also significantly reduced for 30 additional variants, 19 of which had {\textless}25{\%} activity. None of those 30 variants have been previously reported to associate with 5-FU toxicity in clinical association studies, which have been conducted primarily in populations of European ancestry. Using publicly available genotype databases, we confirmed the rarity of these variants in European populations but showed that they are detected at appreciable frequencies in other populations. These data strongly suggest that testing for the reported deficient DPYD variations could dramatically improve predictive genetic tests for 5-FU sensitivity, especially in individuals of non-European descent.},

abstract = {A TP53 gene polymorphism, resulting in an arginine (R) to proline (P) at codon 72 (TP53 R72P), has been associated with the susceptibility to various cancers. To better understand the role of this polymorphism in colorectal cancer etiology, we examined the association between TP53 R72P and colorectal cancer risk in 345 patients with colorectal cancer and 670 controls in a Chinese population. We observed that subjects with RP and PP genotypes had a 1.60-fold and a 2.37-fold increased risk for colorectal cancer, respectively. The 72P allele conferred a more pronounced increase in colorectal cancer risk among alcohol consumers (heterozygotes: OR = 3.01; homozygotes: OR = 4.71). The TP53 R72P polymorphism was not linked to tumor location, histologic grade, lymph node metastases, Dukes stage, p53 positivity, or age at diagnosis, but to tumor size. We conclude that the TP53 R72P polymorphism may contribute to the etiology of colorectal cancer in the Chinese population, particularly among alcohol consumers.},

abstract = {Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE) is an autosomal recessive disorder defined clinically by severe gastrointestinal dysmotility; cachexia; ptosis, ophthalmoparesis, or both; peripheral neuropathy; leukoencephalopathy; and mitochondrial abnormalities. The disease is caused by mutations in the thymidine phosphorylase (TP) gene. TP protein catalyzes phosphorolysis of thymidine to thymine and deoxyribose 1-phosphate. We identified 21 probands (35 patients) who fulfilled our clinical criteria for MNGIE. MNGIE has clinically homogeneous features but varies in age at onset and rate of progression. Gastrointestinal dysmotility is the most prominent manifestation, with recurrent diarrhea, borborygmi, and intestinal pseudo-obstruction. Patients usually die in early adulthood (mean, 37.6 years; range, 26-58 years). Cerebral leukodystrophy is characteristic. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has depletion, multiple deletions, or both. We have identified 16 TP mutations. Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations were present in all patients tested. Leukocyte TP activity was reduced drastically in all patients tested, 0.009 +/- 0.021 micromol/hr/mg (mean +/- SD; n = 16), compared with controls, 0.67 +/- 0.21 micromol/hr/mg (n = 19). MNGIE is a recognizable clinical syndrome caused by mutations in thymidine phosphorylase. Severe reduction of TP activity in leukocytes is diagnostic. Altered mitochondrial nucleoside and nucleotide pools may impair mtDNA replication, repair, or both.},

However, the great individual variability in both outcome and toxicity of platinum chemotherapy requires the identification of genetic markers that can be used to screen patients before treatment.

The glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) Ile105Val polymorphism was strongly associated with progression-free survival (chi(2)=12.12, P=0.002). The allelic status of the GSTA1 -69 C{\textgreater}T polymorphism correlated with the overall survival: patients with T/T genotype survived longer than C/C carriers (P=0.044). Thrombocytopenia, anemia and neuropathy were less frequent among patients with the GSTM1-null or GSTM3 intron 6 AGG/AGG genotypes.

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS
The present study analyzed the relationship between TP53 codon 72 polymorphisms and the clinical outcome of advanced gastric cancer patients receiving capecitabine plus paclitaxel chemotherapy. 

METHODS
Three hundred patients with advanced gastric cancer treated with paclitaxel and capecitabine combination chemotherapy were enrolled in the present study. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes and determined using allele specific polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR). Correlation between TP53 codon 72 polymorphisms and treatment response, gastric cancer survival was analyzed. 

RESULTS
The Pro/Pro genotypes of TP53 codon 72 were significantly correlated with a lower response rate to capecitabine plus paclitaxel chemotherapy in patients with gastric cancer when compared to the Arg/Arg genotype (30.6 vs. 63.2{\%}, p value 0.000). Multivariate survival analysis also showed that the progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for patients with Pro/Pro genotypes of TP53 codon 72 were worse than for those with the Arg/Arg genotype (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.177, p = 0.009; HR = 2.145, p = 0.038, respectively). 

CONCLUSIONS
TP53 codon 72 polymorphisms was effective in predicting the response to chemotherapy and correlate with PFS and OS in patients with advanced gastric cancer treated with paclitaxel and capecitabine chemotherapy.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Delayed-type diarrhea is a common side effect of irinotecan and is associated with a bacterial-mediated formation of the active irinotecan metabolite SN-38 from its glucuronide conjugate in the intestine. Based on a pilot study, we hypothesized that concomitant administration of the antibiotic neomycin would diminish exposure of the gut to SN-38 and ameliorate the incidence and severity of diarrhea. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were treated with irinotecan in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Eligible patients received irinotecan (350 mg/m(2) once every 3 weeks) combined with neomycin (660 mg three times daily for three consecutive days, starting 2 days before chemotherapy) or combined with placebo. Blood samples were obtained for additional pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenetic analyses. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were evaluable for the toxicity analysis. Baseline patient characteristics, systemic SN-38 exposure, and UGT1A1*28 genotype status (i.e., an additional TA repeat in the promoter region of uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase isoform 1A1) were similar in both arms. Although distribution, severity, and duration of delayed-type diarrhea did not differ significantly between arms, grade 3 diarrhea tended to be less frequent in the neomycin arm. The presence of at least one UGT1A1*28 allele was strongly related to the incidence of grade 2-3 diarrhea. In the neomycin arm, grade 2 nausea was significantly more common. CONCLUSION: Our results do not suggest a major role for neomycin as prophylaxis for irinotecan-induced delayed-type diarrhea. It is suggested that the UGT1A1*28 genotype status could be used as a screening tool for a priori prevention of irinotecan-induced delayed-type diarrhea.},

DPYD-rs3918290 and DPYD-rs67376798 were associated to Grade ≥3 toxicity after bootstrap validation and Bonferroni correction (p = 0.003, p = 0.048). DPYD-rs55886062 was not significant likely due to its low allelic frequency, nonetheless one out of two heterozygous patients (compound heterozygous with DPYD-rs3918290) died from toxicity after one cycle. Test specificity for the analysis of DPYD-rs3918290, DPYD-rs55886062 and DPYD-rs67376798 was assessed to 99{\%}.

A hospital-based case-control study consisting of 444 patients and 569 controls was conducted to explore the associations between TP53 Arg72Pro and MDM2 T309G and CRC risk in Chinese. The combined effect of TP53 Arg72Pro and MDM2 T309G was significant in a gene dose-response increasing CRC risk (trend test: P = 0.02). Individuals carrying 3 or more potential risk alleles had 1.78 times risk (95 {\%} CI: 1.13-2.80) to develop CRC compared with individuals without potential risk allele. This increased cancer risk was more pronounced in smokers who carried 3-4 potential risk alleles (OR = 2.75, 95 {\%} CI: 1.14-6.60) and in young subjects (OR = 2.05, 95 {\%} CI: 1.08-3.88). The gene-gene interaction between TP53 Arg72Pro and MDM2 T309G may interact in carcinogenesis of CRC in Chinese, especially in smokers, and this kind of interaction is associated with onset age of CRC.},

abstract = {The tumor suppressor gene TP53 and its negative regulator murine double minute 2 are involved in multiple cellular pathways. Two potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) MDM2 SNP309 and TP53 R72P have been extensively investigated to be associated with breast cancer risk. However, the original studies as well as the subsequent meta-analysis, have yielded contradictory results for the individual effect of the two SNPs on breast cancer risk, plus that conflicting results also existed for the combined effects of MDM2 SNP309 and TP53 R72P on breast cancer risk. This meta-analysis aimed to clarify the individual and combined effects of these two genes on breast cancer risk. We performed a meta-analysis of publications with a total 9,563 cases and 9,468 controls concerning MDM2 SNP309 polymorphism and 19,748 cases and 19,962 controls concerning TP53 R72P. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95 {\%} confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of the association. In overall meta-analysis, individuals with the MDM2 SNP309TG genotype were associated with a borderline higher breast cancer risk than those with TT genotype (OR = 1.11, 95 {\%} CI: 1.00-1.24, P (heterogeneity) = 0.007), whereas the TP53 R72P CC or GC genotype had no effects on breast cancer risk. In the stratified analyses, a significant association between MDM2 SNP309 and breast cancer risk were observed in Asian, but null significant association between TP53 R72P and breast cancer risk were found even in various subgroups. Moreover, no significant combined effects of MDM2 SNP309 and TP53 R72P were observed on breast cancer risk. The borderline association between MDM2 SNP309 and breast cancer risk in overall analysis should be treated with caution, and no significant combined effects for the two SNPs on breast cancer risk suggested functional investigations warranted to explore the molecular mechanism of the TP53-MDM2 circuit genes.},

abstract = {AIMS: The importance of polymorphisms in the dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase gene (DPYD) for the prediction of severe toxicity in 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy is still unclear. This study aims to assess the predictive value of DPYD variation with respect to previously described DPYD variants for 5-FU toxicity. It represents the first analysis of the gene at the haplotype level, also capturing potentially important genetic variation located outside the coding regions of DPYD. MATERIALS {\&} METHODS: The entire coding sequence and exon-flanking intronic regions of DPYD were sequenced in 111 cancer patients receiving fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. DPYD haplotypes were inferred and their associations with severe 5-FU toxicity were assessed. RESULTS: None of the previously described deleterious variants (IVS14+1G{\textgreater}A, c.2846A{\textgreater}T and c.1679T{\textgreater}G) were detected in 24 patients who experienced severe 5-FU toxicity. A potential association was observed between a haplotype containing three novel intronic polymorphisms (IVS5+18G{\textgreater}A, IVS6+139G{\textgreater}A and IVS9-51T{\textgreater}G) and a synonymous mutation (c.1236G{\textgreater}A), which was observed five- out of eight-times in patients with severe adverse effects. CONCLUSION: The association of a haplotype containing no nonsynonymous or splice-site polymorphisms indicates that additional important genetic variation may be located in noncoding gene regions. Furthermore, a comparison with other studies suggests that the relative importance of particular DPYD mutations (IVS14+1G{\textgreater}A and c.2846A{\textgreater}T) for predicting severe 5-FU toxicity differs geographically across Europe.},

abstract = {SN-38 is the active metabolite of irinotecan and it is metabolised through conjugation by uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase (UGT1A1). The major toxicity of irinotecan therapy is diarrhoea, which has been related to the enzymatic activity of UGT1A1. We examined the influence of the UGT1A1 gene promoter polymorphism in the toxicity profile, in the response rate and in the overall survival (OS) in 95 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with an irinotecan-containing chemotherapy. Genotypes were determined by analysing the sequence of TATA box of UGT1A1 of genomic DNA from the patients. Clinical parameters and genotypes were compared by univariate and multivariate statistical methods. The more frequent adverse effects were asthenia (34 patients), diarrhoea (29 patients) and neutropenia (20 patients). Severe diarrhoea was observed in 7/10 homozygous (70{\%}) and 15/45 heterozygous (33{\%}) in comparison to 7/40 (17{\%}) wild-type patients (P=0.005). These results maintained the statistical significance in logistic regression analysis (P=0.01) after adjustment for other clinical relevant variables. The presence of severe haematological toxicity increased from wild-type patients to UGT1A1(*)28 homozygotes, but without achieving statistical significance. No relationship was found between the UGT1A1(*)28 genotypes and infection, nausea or mucositis. In univariate studies, patients with the UGT1A1(*)28 polymorphism showed a trend to a poorer OS (P=0.09). In the multivariate analysis, the genotype was not related to clinical response or to OS. The role of the UGT1A1 genotype as a predictor of toxicity in cancer patients receiving irinotecan demands the performance of a randomized trial to ascertain whether genotype-adjusted dosages of the drug can help to establish safe and effective doses not only for patients with the UGT1A1(*)28 homozygous genotype but also for those with the most common UGT1A1 6/6 or 6/7 genotype.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is involved in the development and progression of lung cancer. Somatic EGFR mutations are predictors of response to treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitors (TKIs) for lung cancer, especially among never smokers. EGFR mutations may occur independently of other genetic alterations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The authors sequenced the EGFR-TK domain and the K-ras and p53 genes from lung tumor tissues from 44 never smokers and 46 smokers. A case-control study also was conducted to examine the relationship between an EGFR single nucleotide polymorphism in the TK domain and the lung cancer through a multivariate logistic regression analysis. In addition, the authors compared cell growth kinetics, EGFR-TKI sensitivity by MTT, and activation of signaling molecules by immunoblot in lung cancer cell lines with and without EGFR-TK mutations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: EGFR-TK mutations were more frequently observed in never smokers (25{\%}) than in smokers (2.2{\%}) (p = 0.001). Excluding cases with a K-ras mutation, the frequency of EGFR-TK domain mutation was still significantly higher in never smokers than in smokers, 26.2{\%} versus 4.5{\%} (p = 0.046). EGFR-TK mutations and K-ras mutations (p = 0.015), and p53 and K-ras mutations (p = 0.015) were mutually exclusive, but p53 and EGFR-TK mutations were not (p = 1.00). During sequencing of the EGFR-TK domain in tumors, an EGFR polymorphism (G2607A) was identified. The genotype AA and AA + AG occurred at a significantly higher frequency in lung cancer cases (n = 122) when compared with controls (n = 147) (odds ratio, 3.39 and 2.67; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.41-8.17 and 1.17-6.08, p = 0.006 and p = 0.02, respectively). This polymorphism was found independently of EGFR-TK mutations in lung cancer cases, indicating that it does not predispose to mutations. In vitro, lung cancer cell lines with EGFR-TK mutations also did not contain K-ras mutations and displayed a lower growth rate (50{\%}, p = 0.013) than EGFR-TK wild-type cell lines. EGFR-TK mutant cell lines were more sensitive to both gefitinib and erlotinib, although relative sensitivity to erlotinib compared with wild-type was less pronounced than for gefitinib. Cell lines with a lower growth rate also expressed higher levels of E-cadherin than faster growing cell lines.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: EGFR-TK mutation frequency is high in never-smoking lung cancer patients and is exclusive of mutation in K-ras but not p53. In addition to somatic EGFR-TK mutations that arise in lung tumors, germline variation in the EGFR-TK domain might also be associated with an increased risk of lung cancer. Somatic EGFR-TK mutations alter cell biology and response to EGFR-TKIs and may be mutation specific.},

Three other variants-DPYD c.1679T{\textgreater}G, c.1236G{\textgreater}A/HapB3, and c.1601G{\textgreater}A-have been associated with DPD deficiency, but no definitive evidence for the clinical validity of these variants is available. The primary objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the clinical validity of c.1679T{\textgreater}G, c.1236G{\textgreater}A/HapB3, and c.1601G{\textgreater}A as predictors of severe fluoropyrimidine-associated toxicity. Methods: We did a systematic review of the literature published before Dec 17, 2014, to identify cohort studies investigating associations between DPYD c.1679T{\textgreater}G, c.1236G{\textgreater}A/HapB3, and c.1601G{\textgreater}A and severe (grade ≥3) fluoropyrimidine-associated toxicity in patients treated with fluoropyrimidines (fluorouracil, capecitabine, or tegafur-uracil as single agents, in combination with other anticancer drugs, or with radiotherapy). Individual patient data were retrieved and analysed in a multivariable analysis to obtain an adjusted relative risk (RR). Effect estimates were pooled by use of a random-effects meta-analysis. The threshold for significance was set at a p value of less than 0{\textperiodcentered}0167 (Bonferroni correction). Findings: 7365 patients from eight studies were included in the meta-analysis. DPYD c.1679T{\textgreater}G was significantly associated with fluoropyrimidine-associated toxicity (adjusted RR 4{\textperiodcentered}40, 95{\%} CI 2{\textperiodcentered}08-9{\textperiodcentered}30, p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001), as was c.1236G{\textgreater}A/HapB3 (1{\textperiodcentered}59, 1{\textperiodcentered}29-1{\textperiodcentered}97, p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001). The association between c.1601G{\textgreater}A and fluoropyrimidine-associated toxicity was not significant (adjusted RR 1{\textperiodcentered}52, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}86-2{\textperiodcentered}70, p=0{\textperiodcentered}15). Analysis of individual types of toxicity showed consistent associations of c.1679T{\textgreater}G and c.1236G{\textgreater}A/HapB3 with gastrointestinal toxicity (adjusted RR 5{\textperiodcentered}72, 95{\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}40-23{\textperiodcentered}33, p=0{\textperiodcentered}015; and 2{\textperiodcentered}04, 1{\textperiodcentered}49-2{\textperiodcentered}78, p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001, respectively) and haematological toxicity (adjusted RR 9{\textperiodcentered}76, 95{\%} CI 3{\textperiodcentered}03-31{\textperiodcentered}48, p=0{\textperiodcentered}00014; and 2{\textperiodcentered}07, 1{\textperiodcentered}17-3{\textperiodcentered}68, p=0{\textperiodcentered}013, respectively), but not with hand-foot syndrome. DPYD*2A and c.2846A{\textgreater}T were also significantly associated with severe fluoropyrimidine-associated toxicity (adjusted RR 2{\textperiodcentered}85, 95{\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}75-4{\textperiodcentered}62, p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001; and 3{\textperiodcentered}02, 2{\textperiodcentered}22-4{\textperiodcentered}10, p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001, respectively). Interpretation: DPYD variants c.1679T{\textgreater}G and c.1236G{\textgreater}A/HapB3 are clinically relevant predictors of fluoropyrimidine-associated toxicity. Upfront screening for these variants, in addition to the established variants DPYD*2A and c.2846A{\textgreater}T, is recommended to improve the safety of patients with cancer treated with fluoropyrimidines.

abstract = {Li-Fraumeni syndrome, resulting from p53 (TP53) germline mutations, represents one of the most devastating genetic predispositions to cancer. Recently, the MDM2 SNP309 (T--{\textgreater}G variation) was shown to be associated with accelerated tumour formation in p53 mutation carriers. The impact of the common p53 codon 72 polymorphism on cancer risk remains controversial. We therefore investigated the effect of these two polymorphisms in 61 French carriers of the p53 germline mutation. The mean age of tumour onset in MDMD2 SNP309 G allele carriers (19.6 years) was significantly different from that observed in patients homozygous for the T allele (29.9 years, p{\textless}0.05). For the p53 codon 72 polymorphism, the mean age of tumour onset in Arg allele carriers (21.8 years) was also different from that of Pro/Pro patients (34.4 years, p{\textless}0.05). We observed a cumulative effect of both polymorphisms because the mean ages of tumour onset in carriers of the MDM2G and p53Arg alleles (16.9 years) and those with the MDM2T/T and p53Pro/Pro genotypes (43 years) were clearly different (p{\textless}0.02). Therefore, our results confirm the impact of the MDM2 SNP309 G allele on the age of tumour onset in germline p53 mutation carriers, and suggest that this effect may be amplified by the p53 72Arg allele. Polymorphisms affecting p53 degradation therefore represent one of the rare examples of modifier genetic factors identified to date in mendelian predispositions to cancer.},

The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence of genetic variants in these receptors and its potential clinical implications in colorectal cancer (CRC).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: VEGFR2, PDGFR$\alpha$ and PDGFR$\beta$ mutations were evaluated by sequencing their tyrosine kinase domains in 8 CRC cell lines and in 92 samples of patients with CRC. Correlations with clinicopathological features and survival were analyzed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Four SNPs were identified, three in PDGFR$\alpha$ [exon 12 (A12): c.1701A{\textgreater}G; exon 13 (A13): c.1809G{\textgreater}A; and exon 17 (A17): c.2439+58C{\textgreater}A] and one in PDGFR$\beta$ [exon 19 (B19): c.2601A{\textgreater}G]. SNP B19, identified in 58{\%} of tumor samples and in 4 cell lines (LS174T, LS180, SW48, COLO205), was associated with higher PDGFR and pPDGFR protein levels. Consistent with this observation, 5-year survival was greater for patients with PDGFR B19 wild type tumors (AA) than for those harboring the G-allele genotype (GA or GG) (51{\%} vs 17{\%}; p=0.073). Multivariate analysis confirmed SNP B19 (p=0.029) was a significant prognostic factor for survival, independent of age (p=0.060) or TNM stage (p{\textless}0.001).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: PDGFR$\beta$ exon 19 c.2601A{\textgreater}G SNP is commonly encountered in CRC patients and is associated with increased pathway activation and poorer survival. Implications regarding its potential influence in response to PDGFR-targeted agents remain to be elucidated.},

abstract = {Thymidine phosphorylase (TYMP), an enzyme involved in nucleotide synthesis, has been implicated in critical biological processes such as DNA replication, protection against mutations, and tissue repair. In this work, we retrospectively evaluated the influence of a polymorphism in the TYMP gene (rs112723255; G/A) upon the outcome of 448 patients subjected to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) from an human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling donor. The TYMP genotype of patients correlated with overall survival-carriers of the minor allele (A) being at an increased risk of dying after transplantation (hazard ratio, HR = 1.9; P = 0.004). This effect was mostly due to differences in transplant toxicity-related mortality (HR = 2.5; P = 0.029). In addition, the TYMP genotype of donors was associated with the risk of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-carriers of the minor allele being at an increased risk of developing this complication ([HR] = 1.7; P = 0.039). The impact of such polymorphism on the risk of chronic GVHD is limited to patients transplanted in early stage disease (HR = 2.2; P = 0.019). The combination of a donor harboring the minor allele with a patient homozygous for the major allele was associated with the highest risk of chronic GVHD (HR = 2.8; P = 0.008). These findings provide the first evidence of the significant impact of the TYMP genotype upon the clinical outcome of patients treated with HLA-identical sibling allo-SCT. Am. J.

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether specific combinations of polymorphisms in genes encoding proteins involved in 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are associated with increased risk of treatment-induced toxicity.$\backslash$nExperimental Design: We analyzed two cohorts of 161 and 340 patients, the exploration and validation cohort, respectively. All patients were treated similarly with 5-FU–based adjuvant chemotherapy. We analyzed 13 functional polymorphisms and applied a four-fold analysis strategy using individual polymorphisms, haplotypes, and phenotypic enzyme activity or expression classifications based on combinations of functional polymorphisms in specific genes. Furthermore, multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis was used to identify a genetic interaction profile indicating an increased risk of toxicity.$\backslash$nResults: Alleles associated with low activity of methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) were associated with decreased risk of toxicity [ORExploration 0.39 (95{\%} CI: 0.21–0.71, P = 0.003), ORValidation 0.63 (95{\%} CI: 0.41–0.95, P = 0.03)]. A specific combination of the MTHFR 1298A{\textgreater}C and thymidylate synthase (TYMS) 3′-UTR (untranslated region) ins/del polymorphisms was significantly associated with increased toxicity in both cohorts [ORExploration 2.40 (95{\%} CI: 1.33–4.29, P = 0.003), ORValidation 1.81 (95{\%} CI: 1.18–2.79, P = 0.007)]. The specific combination was also associated with increased cumulative incidence and earlier occurrence of severe toxicity during treatment.$\backslash$nConclusions: Our results indicate that MTHFR activity and a specific combination of the MTHFR 1298A{\textgreater}C and TYMS 3′-UTR ins/del polymorphisms are possible predictors of 5-FU treatment–related toxicity.

abstract = {Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) is the enzyme catalyzing the first step of pyrimidine metabolism. To date, genetic polymorphisms of pyrimidine-synthesizing enzymes have been reported to be associated with the risk of malignant lymphoma or colon cancer. Accordingly, there may be associations between dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPYD) polymorphism and the risk of malignancies. We conducted a prevalent case-control study to investigate the associations between a functional polymorphism of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, DPYD T85C, and the risk of six malignancies. Controls were 445 Nagoya City inhabitants without a history of malignancy who had participated in a health check-up between August and September 2000. Case subjects were 901 patients with malignancies (99 esophageal, 131 gastric, 143 colon, 179 lung, 243 breast, and 106 malignant lymphomas) who had visited Aichi Cancer Center Hospital between March 1999 and December 2000. No DPYD CC individuals were found in either cases or controls. The frequency of DPYD TC genotype was 6.3{\%} in control subjects and 5.9{\%} in all case subjects (not significant). In a subgroup analysis, the frequency of TC genotype was highest in patients with gastric cancer (9.1{\%}), followed by those with lung cancer (8.3{\%}), with the lowest frequency in those with malignant lymphoma (1.9{\%}). The gender- and age- adjusted odds ratios and 95{\%} confidence intervals for the TC genotype of gastric cancer and malignant lymphoma were 1.52 (0.71-3.28) and 0.31 (0.71-1.34), respectively. Although prevalent cases were used, this study suggested that the influence of DPYD T85C posed only a limited risk for the six malignancies.},

abstract = {Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) is the initial and rate-limiting enzyme in the catabolism of the pyrimidine bases uracil, thymine and the antineoplastic agent 5-fluorouracil. Genetic variations in the gene encoding DPD (DPYD) have emerged as predictive risk alleles for 5FU-associated toxicity. Here we report an in-depth analysis of genetic variants in DPYD and their consequences for DPD activity and pyrimidine metabolites in 100 Dutch healthy volunteers. 34 SNPs were detected in DPYD and 15 SNPs were associated with altered plasma concentrations of pyrimidine metabolites. DPD activity was significantly associated with the plasma concentrations of uracil, the presence of a specific DPYD mutation (c.1905. +. 1G. {\textgreater}. A) and the combined presence of three risk variants in DPYD (c.1905. +. 1G. {\textgreater}. A, c.1129-5923C. {\textgreater}. G, c.2846A. {\textgreater}. T), but not with an altered uracil/dihydrouracil (U/UH2) ratio. Various haplotypes were associated with different DPD activities (haplotype D3, a decreased DPD activity; haplotype F2, an increased DPD activity). Functional analysis of eight recombinant mutant DPD enzymes showed a reduced DPD activity, ranging from 35{\%} to 84{\%} of the wild-type enzyme. Analysis of a DPD homology model indicated that the structural effect of the novel p.G401R mutation is most likely minor. The clinical relevance of the p.D949V mutation was demonstrated in a cancer patient heterozygous for the c.2846A. {\textgreater}. T mutation and a novel nonsense mutation c.1681C. {\textgreater}.

abstract = {In this report, we describe combined polymorphisms of the UGT1A9, UGT1A7 and UGT1A1 genes in 100 unrelated, healthy Chinese Han subjects. The functional regions of these genes were sequenced and comprehensively analyzed for genetic polymorphisms. Thirty variants were detected, including five novel forms. Tentative functional predictions indicated that a Cys → Arg substitution at position 277 in the UGT1A7 gene could alter the protein conformation and that 12460T {\textgreater} G in the 3'UTR might influence protein translation through specifically expressed miRNAs. UGT1A9*1b was a major functional variant in the subjects examined whereas the *1f allele had a frequency of only 0.5{\%}. A special functional haplotype (GAGAAC) was identified for UGT1A9, 1A7 and 1A1. These findings provide fundamental genetic information that may serve as a basis for larger studies designed to assess the metabolic phenotypes associated with UGT1A polymorphisms. They also provide important data for the implementation of personalized medicine in Chinese Han.},

abstract = {The incidence of endometrial cancer, a common gynecological malignancy, is increasing in Japan. We have previously shown that the ER/MDM2/p53/p21 pathway plays an important role in endometrial carcinogenesis. In the present study, we investigated the effects of germline single nucleotide polymorphisms in murine double minute 2 (MDM2) SNP309, TP53 Arg72Pro, ESR1 PvuII and XbaI, and p21 codon 31 on endometrial cancer risk. We evaluated these polymorphisms in DNA samples from 125 endometrial cancer cases and 200 controls using polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism. The association of each genetic polymorphism with endometrial cancer was examined by the odds ratio and 95{\%} confidence interval, which were obtained using logistic regression analysis. The SNP309 GG genotype non-significantly increased the risk of endometrial cancer. The 95{\%} confidence interval for the GG genotype vs. the TT genotype of MDM2 SNP309 was 1.76 (0.93-3.30). Endometrial cancer was not associated with tested SNP genotypes for TP53, ESR1 and p21. The combination of SNP309 GG + TG and TP53 codon 72 Arg/Arg significantly increased endometrial cancer risk. The adjusted OR was 2.53 (95{\%} confidence interval, 1.03-6.21) and P for the interaction was 0.04. This result was supported by in vitro data showing that endometrial cancer cell lines with the SNP309 G allele failed to show growth inhibition by treatment with RITA, which reduces p53-MDM2 binding. The presence of the SNP309 G allele and TP53 codon 72 Arg/Arg genotype is associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer in Japanese women.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: UGT1A1*28 polymorphism has been associated with decreased glucuronidation of SN38, the active metabolite of irinotecan. This could increase toxicity with this agent. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a prospective study, 250 metastatic colorectal cancer patients were treated with irinotecan, fluorouracil, and leucovorin as first-line treatment. UGT1A1*28 polymorphism was investigated with respect to the distribution of hematologic and nonhematologic toxicity, objective response rate, and survival. Pharmacokinetics was investigated in a subgroup of patients (71 of 250) who had been analyzed with respect to toxicity and efficacy. RESULTS: UGT1A1*28 polymorphism was associated with a higher risk of grade 3 to 4 hematologic toxicity (odds ratio [OR], 8.63; 95{\%} CI, 1.31 to 56.55), which was only relevant for the first cycle, and was not seen throughout the whole treatment period for patients with both variant alleles TA7/TA7 compared with wild-type TA6/TA6. The response rate was also higher in TA7/TA7 patients (OR, 0.32; 95{\%} CI, 0.12 to 0.86) compared with TA6/TA6. A nonsignificant survival advantage was observed for TA7/TA7 when compared with TA6/TA6 patients (hazard ratio, 0.81; 95{\%} CI, 0.45 to 1.44). Higher response rates were explained by a different pharmacokinetics with higher biliary index [irinotecan area under the curve (AUC)x(SN38 AUC/SN38G AUC)] and lower glucuronidation ratio (SN38G AUC/SN38 AUC) associated with the TA7/TA7 genotype and a higher response rate, indicating that the polymorphism is functionally relevant. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that UGT1A1*28 polymorphism is of some relevance to toxicity; however, it is less important than discussed in previous smaller trials. In particular, the possibility of a dose reduction for irinotecan in patients with a UGT1A1*28 polymorphism is not supported by the result of this analysis.},

abstract = {In this marker evaluation study, we tested whether distinct patterns of functional genomic polymorphisms in genes involved in drug metabolic pathways and DNA repair that predict clinical outcome to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/oxaliplatin chemotherapy in patients with advanced colorectal cancer could be identified. Functional polymorphisms in DNA-repair genes XPD, ERCC1, XRCC1, XPA, and metabolising genes glutathione S-transferase GSTP1, GSTT1, GSTM1, and thymidylate synthase (TS) were assessed retrospectively in 106 patients with refractory stage IV disease who received 5-FU/oxaliplatin combination chemotherapy, using a polymerase chain reaction-based RFLP technique. Favourable genotypes from polymorphisms in XPD-751, ERCC1-118, GSTP1-105, and TS-3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) that are associated with overall survival were identified. After adjustment for performance status, the relative risks of dying for patients who possessed the unfavourable genotype were: 3.33 for XPD-751 (P=0.037), 3.25 for GSTP1-105 (P=0.072), 2.05 for ERCC1-118 (P=0.037), and 1.65 for TS-3'UTR (P=0.091) when compared to their respective beneficial genomic variants. Combination analysis with all four polymorphisms revealed that patients possessing {\textgreater} or =2 favourable genotypes survived a median of 17.4 months (95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 9.4, 26.5) compared to 5.4 months (95{\%} CI: 4.3, 6.0) in patients with no favourable genotype. Patients who carried one favourable genotype demonstrated intermediate survival of 10.2 months (95{\%} CI: 6.8, 15.3; P{\textless}0.001). Polymorphisms in the TS-3'UTR and GSTP1-105 gene were also associated with time to progression. After adjustment for performance status, patients with an unfavourable TS-3'UTR genotype had a relative risk of disease progression of 1.76 (P=0.020) and those with the unfavourable GSTP1-105 genotype showed a relative risk of progression of 2.00 (P=0.018). The genomic polymorphisms XPD-751, ERCC1-118, GSTP1-105, and TS-3'UTR may be useful in predicting overall survival and time to progression of colorectal cancer in patients who receive 5-FU/oxaliplatin chemotherapy. These findings require independent prospective confirmation.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The polymorphism of p53 codon 72 (Arg72Pro) has been suggested to play an important role in many cancers and may influence the response to chemotherapy. Our aim was to investigate the association of p53 Arg72Pro polymorphism with the clinical outcome of gastric cancer patients treated with 5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy. METHODS: The p53 codon 72 genotype was determined in blood samples from 110 Chinese patients with gastric cancer treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based adjuvant chemotherapy, using polymerase chain reaction-ligation detection reaction (PCR-LDR) method. RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that gastric cancer patients with Pro/Pro genotype had shorter relapse-free survival (chi(2) = 10.632, P = 0.005) and overall survival (chi(2) = 7.104, P = 0.029) than patients with other genotypes. Cox multivariate analysis showed that Pro/Pro genotype was associated with statistically significant reduced relapse-free survival (adjusted OR = 3.049, 95{\%} CI: 1.363-6.819, P = 0.007) and overall survival (adjusted OR = 2.581, 95{\%} CI: 1.052-6.330, P = 0.038). CONCLUSION: These results suggested that p53 codon 72 polymorphism appears to be an independent prognostic factor in gastric cancer patients treated with 5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy.},

abstract = {Individuals who inherit mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 are predisposed to breast and ovarian cancers. However, identifying mutations in these large genes by conventional dideoxy sequencing in a clinical testing laboratory is both time consuming and costly, and similar challenges exist for other large genes, or sets of genes, with relevance in the clinical setting. Second-generation sequencing technologies have the potential to improve the efficiency and throughput of clinical diagnostic sequencing, once clinically validated methods become available. We have developed a method for detection of variants based on automated small-amplicon PCR followed by sample pooling and sequencing with a second-generation instrument. To demonstrate the suitability of this method for clinical diagnostic sequencing, we analyzed the coding exons and the intron-exon boundaries of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in 91 hereditary breast cancer patient samples. Our method generated high-quality sequence coverage across all targeted regions, with median coverage greater than 4000-fold for each sample in pools of 24. Sensitive and specific automated variant detection, without false-positive or false-negative results, was accomplished with a standard software pipeline using bwa for sequence alignment and samtools for variant detection. We experimentally derived a minimum threshold of 100-fold sequence depth for confident variant detection. The results demonstrate that this method is suitable for sensitive, automatable, high-throughput sequence variant detection in the clinical laboratory.

abstract = {The P53 tumor suppressor pathway plays an important role in cancer development. The auto-regulatory feedback mechanism of the P53 and MDM2 expression is critical in keeping proper tumor suppressor function of this pathway. This study examined the effect of P53 Arg72Pro variants on transactivation of polymorphic MDM2 promoter (T309G) and their associations with risk of developing gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA) in a Chinese population. Luciferase assays consistently showed a significantly higher activity of the MDM2 309G promoter compared with the MDM2 309T promoter. In cells co-transfected with variant P53 cDNAs, P53-72Pro displayed a significantly higher ability to activate the MDM2 promoter than P53-72Arg. Genotype analyses in 500 GCA patients and 1000 controls showed that significantly increased risk for developing GCA was associated with the MDM2 309G and the P53 72Pro allele compared with the MDM2 309T and the P53 72Arg allele in an allele dose-dependent manner. A joint effect between the MDM2 and P53 polymorphisms in intensifying GCA risk was detected, with the odds ratio (OR) for the presence of both MDM2 390GG and P53 72Pro/Pro genotypes being 5.05 [95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 2.50-10.20]. These results suggest that the P53 72Pro and MDM2 309G polymorphisms contribute to the risk of developing GCA.},

abstract = {The Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) is a rare, dominantly inherited syndrome that features high risk of cancers in childhood and early adulthood. Affected families tend to develop bone and soft tissue sarcomas, breast cancers, brain tumors, leukemias, and adrenocortical carcinomas. In some kindreds, the genetic abnormality associated with this cancer phenotype is a heterozygous germline mutation in the p53 tumor suppressor gene. Recently, we identified one patient who presented in early childhood with multiple primary cancers and who harbored three germline p53 alterations (R156H and R267Q on the maternal allele and R290H on the paternal allele). To classify the biologic effects of these alterations, functional properties of each of the p53 mutants were examined using in vitro assays of cellular growth suppression and transcriptional activation. Each amino acid substitution conferred partial or complete loss of wild-type p53 function, but the child completed normal embryonic development. This observation has not been previously reported in a human, but is consistent with observations of normal embryogenesis in p53-deficient mice.},

@article{Bojesen2008,
abstract = {More than ten million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified in humans; however, the importance of most SNPs for health and disease is not understood. Most SNPs are indeed unimportant and because of often inadequately powered studies, many observations on SNP effects can not be repeated by other researchers. SNPs are at best shown to influence protein function or level, rarely to influence risk of disease, and almost never to influence total mortality, the ultimate endpoint. A wellknown functional SNP in the tumor suppressor TP53 gene leads to increased longevity: in the Danish general population (n = 9219) homozygotes for the minor allele versus homozygotes for the major allele had an increase in median survival of 3 years. This is partly explained by increased survival after development of cancer or other diseases, in accordance with the observation that this Arg72Pro substitution in the p53 protein has important influence on cell death via increased apoptosis. Thus, the increased longevity may be due to a generally increased robustness after a diagnosis of any life-threatening disease. In contrast to widespread skepticism on the importance of SNPs in humans, this gain-of-function p53 SNP of importance for cell repair mechanisms has a profound influence on longevity.},

abstract = {Objective: Conventional therapies are still unsuccessful in patients with carcinoma arising from the biliary tract. Somatic mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene and the activation of its downstream pathways predict the sensitivity to small-molecule inhibitors in non–small cell lung carcinoma. Therefore, we analyzed EGFR mutations and related pathways in gallbladder and bile duct carcinomas to consider the possible application of these alternative therapeutic strategies.$\backslash$nExperimental Design: Forty paraffin-embedded samples, including intrahepatic or extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder carcinoma, were studied after tumor cell isolation by laser microdissection and sequencing of EGFR tyrosine kinase domain (exons 18-21). Activation of EGFR pathway was studied by evaluating phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt.$\backslash$nResults: None of the 40 specimens had mutations in exon 18; one had one missense point mutation in exon 19, two in exon 20, and three in exon 21. In addition, 36 of 40 specimens had the same silent mutation at codon 787 in exon 20, which was also found in peripheral blood cells from healthy donors. Tumor samples harboring EGFR mutation had phosphorylation of one or both downstream transducers analyzed.$\backslash$nConclusions: This is the first evidence of somatic mutations of the EGFR gene in bile duct carcinoma. Our findings suggest that a subgroup of patients with cholangiocarcinoma or gallbladder carcinoma exhibits somatic mutations of EGFR in the tyrosine kinase domain that can elicit cell signals sustaining survival and proliferation. These tumors might be further evaluated for their susceptibility to small-molecule inhibitor treatment.},
