abstract = {Conducted vasodilation along arterioles manifests the spread of hyperpolarization through gap junction channels along endothelium. Whereas histamine increases the permeability of capillary and venular endothelium, its effect on the integrity of arteriolar endothelium is unknown. We tested whether histamine could inhibit conducted vasodilation. In second-order arterioles (2A) supplying the cremaster muscle of C57BL6, PECAM-1-/-, and eNOS-/- mice (8-12 wk), neither resting (16+/-2 microm) nor maximal (38+/-2 microm) diameters were different. Acetylcholine (ACh) microiontophoresis (1 microA, 500 ms pulse) triggered vasodilation that was conducted {\textgreater}1400 microm along arterioles. Neither local (14+/-2 microm) nor conducted vasodilation (10+/-2 microm) was different among mice. Histamine (5 microM) had no effect on resting diameter or local vasodilation to ACh yet inhibited conduction by {\textgreater}50{\%} in C57BL6 and PECAM-1-/- mice (P{\textless}0.05); this effect was abolished after blockade of NO synthase or of soluble guanylate cyclase. Washout of histamine restored conduction, though recovery was longer (P{\textless}0.05) in PECAM-1-/- mice vs. C57BL6 mice. Remarkably, conducted vasodilation in eNOS-/- mice was insensitive to histamine. These findings indicate that histamine inhibits cell-to-cell coupling through an NO-dependent mechanism and suggests a dynamic interaction among intercellular adhesion molecules and gap junction channels along arteriolar endothelium.},

abstract = {The acyclic chelator H 6 phospa and the bifunctional derivative p-SCN–Bn–H 6 phospa have been syn-thesized using nosyl protection chemistry and evaluated with 89 Zr, 111 In, and 177 Lu. The p-SCN–Bn– H 6 phospa derivative was successfully conjugated to trastuzumab with isotopic dilution assays indicating 3.3 ± 0.1 chelates per antibody and in vitro cellular binding assays indicating an immunoreactivity value of 97.9 ± 2.6{\%}. Radiolabeling of the H 6 phospa-trastuzumab immunoconjugate was achieved with 111 In in 70–90{\%} yields at room temperature in 30 minutes, while 177 Lu under the same conditions produced more inconsistent yields of 40–80{\%}. Stability experiments in human serum revealed the 111 In-phospa-trastuzumab complex to be 52.0 ± 5.3{\%} intact after 5 days at 37 °C, while the 177 Lu-phospa-trastuzumab to be only 2.0 ± 0.3{\%} intact. Small animal SPECT/CT imaging using mice bearing subcutaneous SKOV-3 ovarian cancer xenografts was performed, and it was found that 111 In-phospa-trastuzumab successfully identified and delineated small (∼2 mm in diameter) tumors from surrounding tissues, despite visible uptake in the kidneys and bone due to moderate chelate instability. As predicted from stability assays in serum, the 177 Lu-phospa-trastuzumab conjugate served as a negative control and displayed no tumor uptake, with high uptake in bones indicating rapid and complete radiometal dissociation and suggesting a potential application of H 6 phospa in transient lanthanide chelation for bone-delivery. Radiolabeling with 89 Zr was attempted, but even with elevated temperatures of 37 °C, the maximum observed radio-metal incorporation over 18 hours was 12{\%}. It can be concluded from this work that H 6 phospa is not superior to the previously studied H 4 octapa for use with 111 In and 177 Lu, but improvements in 89 Zr radiolabeling were observed over H 4 octapa, suggesting H 6 phospa to be an excellent starting point for elaboration of 89 Zr-based radiopharmaceutical development. To our knowledge, H 6 phospa is the best desferrioxamine alternative for 89 Zr radiolabeling to be studied to date.},
annote = {Zr - zirconium
ln - lanthanide
Lu - lutetium
- decay, half-life
- SPECT/CT - SPECT: image tumour; CT: bone and radiometal - better localization
- DFO most used in Zr radiolabeling
- cyclic - better binding, entropy goes down, stable, downside: higher temp required for chelation
- acyclic - easier to get radiometal chelated, can use RT, less stable

Trastuzumab/Herceptin = mab for HER2

H6 phospa chelates better than H6 octapa? It does only for Zr and not the others},

abstract = {Distinct peptide-MHC-II complexes, recognised by Type A and B CD4(+) T-cell subsets, are generated when antigen is loaded in different intracellular compartments. Conventional Type A T cells recognize their peptide epitope regardless of the route of processing, whereas unconventional Type B T cells only recognise exogenously supplied peptide. Type B T cells are implicated in autoimmune conditions and may break tolerance by escaping negative selection. Here we show that Salmonella differentially influences presentation of antigen to Type A and B T cells. Infection of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) reduced presentation of antigen to Type A T cells but enhanced presentation of exogenous peptide to Type B T cells. Exposure to S. Typhimurium was sufficient to enhance Type B T-cell activation. Salmonella Typhimurium infection reduced surface expression of MHC-II, by an invariant chain-independent trafficking mechanism, resulting in accumulation of MHC-II in multi-vesicular bodies. Reduced MHC-II surface expression in S. Typhimurium-infected BMDCs correlated with reduced antigen presentation to Type A T cells. Salmonella infection is implicated in reactive arthritis. Therefore, polarisation of antigen presentation towards a Type B response by Salmonella may be a predisposing factor in autoimmune conditions such as reactive arthritis.},

annote = {Background
- FPN1 recycles iron for erythrocyte production
- Erythrocute damage is bad for the organism
- RBC = Ter119+CD45-
- WBC = Ter119-CD45+

Hypothesis
- Vertebrates have evolved mechanisms that can adapt to fluctuations in erythrocyte integrity

Methods
- RBC = Ter119+CD45- (label with PKH26 ex vivo and tracking in vivo)
- Young RBC circulates for 16 h, sRBC disappear quickly in circulation

Results
Phenotype
- sRBC co-localized with WBC pre-dominantly in the liver + spleen, bm, blood, and lung
- No spleen and liver, sRBC stays in the blood
- Liver: steady, abundant KCs and CD11b(high) cells (transient macrophages, tmo); sRBC leads to fluctuations of WBC in the liver, after 3hr monocyte peaks in liver, after 16hr tmo appear in the liver, KCs diminished
- Spleen: only monocyte accumulated not tmo
- sRBC uptake by WBC
- tmo in liver contained the largest proportion of sRBCs; no tmo appeared in spleen, bm, kidney, or lung
- tmo in liver, monocytes in spleen
Mechanism
- iron is stored ferritin bound or exported via FPN1 
- increased FPN1 surface expression on tmo in liver
- does monocyte differentiate to tmo? 16hrs later, GFP+Ly-6Chigh monocyte became tmo; 72 hrs later, resembled KCs
- Liver has high Csf1/2 ratio compared to spleen
- Csf1 leads to amplification of FPN1 Ly-6C high monocytes in response to sRBCs whereas Csf1 surpresses it
- Csf1-FPN1 enhancement requires the TF Nrf2
- These data show that Nrf2 and Csf1 guide the production and maintenance of iron-recycling macrophages in the liver, whereas Csf2 antagonizes iron recycling in the spleen under stress.
- Ccl2 and Ccl3 guide monocyte to liver; Ccl21 decrease in the spleen},
