abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sporadic colorectal cancers often arise from a region of cells characterized by a "field defect" that has not been well defined molecularly. DNA methylation has been proposed as a candidate mediator of this field defect. The DNA repair gene O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is frequently methylated in colorectal cancer. We hypothesized that MGMT methylation could be one of the mediators of field cancerization in the colon mucosa. METHODS: We studied MGMT promoter methylation by three different bisulfite-based techniques in tumor, adjacent mucosa, and non-adjacent mucosa from 95 colorectal cancer patients and in colon mucosa from 33 subjects with no evidence of cancer. Statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: MGMT promoter methylation was present in 46{\%} of the tumors. Patients whose cancer had MGMT promoter methylation also had substantial MGMT promoter methylation in apparently normal adjacent mucosa. This methylation was seen with a quantitative assay in 50{\%} (22/44; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 34{\%} to 65{\%}) of normal samples with MGMT promoter methylation in the adjacent tumors, 6{\%} (3/51; 95{\%} CI = 1{\%} to 16{\%}) of samples without MGMT methylation in adjacent tumors, and 12{\%} (4/33; 95{\%} CI = 3{\%} to 28{\%}) of control samples (P {\textless} .001 for comparison between each of the latter two groups and the first group). MGMT methylation was detected with a more sensitive assay in 94{\%}, 34{\%}, and 27{\%} of these samples, respectively (P {\textless} .001). In grossly normal colonic mucosa of colon cancer patients, methylation was detected 10 cm away from the tumor in 10 of 13 cases. Tumors with MGMT promoter methylation had a higher rate of G-to-A mutation in the KRAS oncogene than tumors without MGMT promoter methylation (10/42 versus 3/46, P = .03). Using a sensitive mutant allele-specific amplification assay for KRAS mutations, we also found KRAS mutations in 12{\%} (3/25; 95{\%} CI = 2.5{\%} to 31{\%}) of colorectal mucosas with detectable MGMT methylation and 3{\%} (2/64; 95{\%} CI = 0.4{\%} to 11{\%}) of colorectal mucosas without MGMT methylation (P = .13). CONCLUSION: Some colorectal cancers arise from a field defect defined by epigenetic inactivation of MGMT. Detection of this abnormality may ultimately be useful in risk assessment for colorectal cancer.},

abstract = {Recurrence is a significant clinical problem for patients with rectal cancer treated with adjuvant chemoradiation. Previous studies have suggested that determining intratumoral gene expression of key genes may be helpful in predicting clinical outcome of patients with gastrointestinal malignancies undergoing chemotherapy. The role of molecular predictors for prediction of recurrence in the setting of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy is not well established. The present study was designed to identify a genetic profile that would be associated with recurrence in patients with rectal cancer treated with adjuvant chemoradiation therapy. A retrospective study with a longitudinal cohort and a cross-sectional cohort of 67 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who underwent cancer resection, followed by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) plus pelvic radiation was conducted. Total RNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, laser-captured-microdissected tissue. We determined mRNA levels of genes involved in the 5-FU pathway (thymidylate synthase, dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase), DNA-repair (excision-repair cross-complementing factor 1, Rad51), angiogenesis/radiation sensitivity [vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)] and radio-sensitivity [epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)] in tumor tissue and tumor-adjacent normal tissue by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. In univariate analysis, only intratumoral gene expression level of VEGF (P = 0.055) was associated with recurrence, whereas elevated mRNA expression levels of thymidylate synthase (P = 0.008), VEGF (P = 0.023) and EGFR (P = 0.004) in tumor-adjacent normal tissue were significantly associated with recurrence. Multivariate analysis using recursive partitioning indicated that distinct groups of recurrence could be defined by elevated mRNA expression levels of VEGF, EGFR in tumor-adjacent normal tissue, and Rad51 in tumor tissue. These data suggest that the genetic profile of the tumor-adjacent normal tissue may be associated with treatment failure, indicating that tumor microenvironment may be more important in the development of recurrence of rectal tumors than formerly expected.},
