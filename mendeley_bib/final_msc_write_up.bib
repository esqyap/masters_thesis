abstract = {A majority of cancers are driven by genomic alterations that dysregulate key oncogenic pathways influencing cell growth and survival. However, the ability to harness tumor genetic information for its full clinical potential has only recently become manifest. Over the past several years, the convergence of discovery, technology, and therapeutic development has created an unparalleled opportunity to test the hypothesis that systematic knowledge of genomic information from individual tumors can improve clinical outcomes for many patients with cancer. Rigorous evaluation of this genomics-driven cancer medicine hypothesis will require many logistic innovations that are guided by overarching conceptual advances in tumor genomic profiling, data interpretation, clinical trial design, and the ethical return of genetic results to oncologists and their patients. The results of these efforts and the rigor with which they are implemented will determine whether and how comprehensive tumor genomic information may become incorporated into the routine care of patients with cancer.},

@article{Goodwin2016,
abstract = {Since the completion of the human genome project in 2003, extraordinary progress has been made in genome sequencing technologies, which has led to a decreased cost per megabase and an increase in the number and diversity of sequenced genomes. An astonishing complexity of genome architecture has been revealed, bringing these sequencing technologies to even greater advancements. Some approaches maximize the number of bases sequenced in the least amount of time, generating a wealth of data that can be used to understand increasingly complex phenotypes. Alternatively, other approaches now aim to sequence longer contiguous pieces of DNA, which are essential for resolving structurally complex regions. These and other strategies are providing researchers and clinicians a variety of tools to probe genomes in greater depth, leading to an enhanced understanding of how genome sequence variants underlie phenotype and disease.},

@article{Youn2011,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: Major tumor sequencing projects have been conducted in the past few years to identify genes that contain 'driver' somatic mutations in tumor samples. These genes have been defined as those for which the non-silent mutation rate is significantly greater than a background mutation rate estimated from silent mutations. Several methods have been used for estimating the background mutation rate.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We propose a new method for identifying cancer driver genes, which we believe provides improved accuracy. The new method accounts for the functional impact of mutations on proteins, variation in background mutation rate among tumors and the redundancy of the genetic code. We reanalyzed sequence data for 623 candidate genes in 188 non-small cell lung tumors using the new method. We found several important genes like PTEN, which were not deemed significant by the previous method. At the same time, we determined that some genes previously reported as drivers were not significant by the new analysis because mutations in these genes occurred mainly in tumors with large background mutation rates.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY: The software is available at: http://linus.nci.nih.gov/Data/YounA/software.zip.},

@article{Ashley2016,
abstract = {There is great potential for genome sequencing to enhance patient care through improved diagnostic sensitivity and more precise therapeutic targeting. To maximize this potential, genomics strategies that have been developed for genetic discovery - including DNA-sequencing technologies and analysis algorithms - need to be adapted to fit clinical needs. This will require the optimization of alignment algorithms, attention to quality-coverage metrics, tailored solutions for paralogous or low-complexity areas of the genome, and the adoption of consensus standards for variant calling and interpretation. Global sharing of this more accurate genotypic and phenotypic data will accelerate the determination of causality for novel genes or variants. Thus, a deeper understanding of disease will be realized that will allow its targeting with much greater therapeutic precision.},

abstract = {Next-generation sequencing has allowed identification of millions of so-matic mutations and epigenetic changes in cancer cells. A key challenge in interpreting cancer genomes and epigenomes is distinguishing which genetic and epigenetic changes are drivers of cancer development. Frequency-based and function-based approaches have been developed to identify candidate drivers; we discuss the advantages and drawbacks of these methods as well as their latest refinements. We focus particularly on identification of the types of drivers most likely to be missed, such as genes affected by copy number alterations, mutations in noncoding regions, dysregulation of microRNA, epigenetic changes, and mutations in chromatin modifiers.},

@article{Vogelstein2013,
abstract = {Over the past decade, comprehensive sequencing efforts have revealed the genomic landscapes of common forms of human cancer. For most cancer types, this landscape consists of a small number of "mountains" (genes altered in a high percentage of tumors) and a much larger number of "hills" (genes altered infrequently). To date, these studies have revealed similar to 140 genes that, when altered by intragenic mutations, can promote or "drive" tumorigenesis. A typical tumor contains two to eight of these "driver gene" mutations; the remaining mutations are passengers that confer no selective growth advantage. Driver genes can be classified into 12 signaling pathways that regulate three core cellular processes: cell fate, cell survival, and genome maintenance. A better understanding of these pathways is one of the most pressing needs in basic cancer research. Even now, however, our knowledge of cancer genomes is sufficient to guide the development of more effective approaches for reducing cancer morbidity and mortality.},

- Examine dividing cancer cells under the microscope, presence of chromosomal aberrations

- Ph translocation (1960)

- introduction of total genomic DNA from human cancers into phenotypically normal NIH3T3 cells could convert them into cancer cells (1982)
- Isolation of the specific DNA segment responsible for this transforming activity led to the identification of the first naturally occurring, human cancer-causing sequence change—the single base G.Tsubstitution that causes a glycine to valine substitutionin codon 12 of the HRAS gene
- This seminal discovery in 1982 inaugurated
an era of vigorous searching for the abnormal genes underlying the development of human cancer that continues today
