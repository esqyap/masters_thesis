abstract = {Cryopyrinopathies are a group of rare autoinflammatory diseases that includes familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome, Muckle-Wells syndrome and chronic infantile neurologic cutaneous articular syndrome (also termed neonatal-onset multisystemic inflammatory disease). These syndromes were initially considered to be distinct disease entities despite some clinical similarities; however, mutations of the same gene have since been found in all three cryopyrinopathies. These diseases, therefore, are not separate but represent a continuum of subphenotypes. The gene in question, CIAS1 (now renamed NLRP3) encodes NALP3 (also known as cryopyrin). NALP3 is an important mediator of inflammation and interleukin 1beta processing. New therapies based on biologic agents that specifically target interleukin 1beta are currently being developed. These new agents have provided very encouraging results for patients with these long-lasting inflammatory conditions--which used to be considered refractory to treatment. The development of therapeutic options for these cryopyrinopathies illustrates effective translation of basic science to clinical practice and the convergence of human genetics and targeted therapies.},

@article{Franchi2012b,
abstract = {Inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes that activate caspase-1, which leads to maturation of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 1$\beta$ (IL-1$\beta$) and IL-18 and the induction of pyroptosis. Members of the Nod-like receptor (NLR) family, including NLRP1, NLRP3 and NLRC4, and the cytosolic receptor AIM2 are critical components of inflammasomes and link microbial and endogenous danger signals to the activation of caspase-1. In response to microbial infection, activation of the inflammasomes contributes to host protection by inducing immune responses that limit microbial invasion, but deregulated activation of inflammasomes is associated with autoinflammatory syndromes and other pathologies. Thus, understanding inflammasome pathways may provide insight into the mechanisms of host defense against microbes and the development of inflammatory disorders.},

@article{Gabay2010b,
abstract = {Interleukin (IL)-1 was first cloned in the 1980s, and rapidly emerged as a key player in the regulation of inflammatory processes. The term IL-1 refers to two cytokines, IL-1alpha and IL-1beta, which are encoded by two separate genes. The effects of IL-1 are tightly controlled by several naturally occurring inhibitors, such as IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), IL-1 receptor type II (IL-1RII), and other soluble receptors. Numerous IL-1 inhibitors have been developed and tested primarily in rheumatoid arthritis, with only modest effects. By contrast, the use of IL-1 antagonists has been uniformly associated with beneficial effects in patients with hereditary autoinflammatory conditions associated with excessive IL-1 signaling, such as cryopyrinopathies and IL-1Ra deficiency. Successful treatment with IL-1 blockers has also been reported in other hereditary autoinflammatory diseases, as well as in nonhereditary inflammatory diseases, such as Schnizler syndrome, systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis and adult Still disease. The role of microcrystals in the regulation of IL-1beta processing and release has provided the rationale for the use of IL-1 inhibitors in crystal-induced arthritis. Finally, preliminary results indicating that IL-1 targeting is efficacious in type 2 diabetes and smoldering myeloma have further broadened the spectrum of IL-1-driven diseases.},
