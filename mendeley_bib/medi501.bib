abstract = {The correlation between mRNA and protein abundances in the cell has been reported to be notoriously poor. Recent technological advances in the quantitative analysis of mRNA and protein species in complex samples allow the detailed analysis of this pathway at the center of biological systems. We give an overview of available methods for the identification and quantification of free and ribosome-bound mRNA, protein abundances and individual protein turnover rates. We review available literature on the correlation of mRNA and protein abundances and discuss biological and technical parameters influencing the correlation of these central biological molecules.},

@article{Neven2008b,
abstract = {Cryopyrinopathies are a group of rare autoinflammatory diseases that includes familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome, Muckle-Wells syndrome and chronic infantile neurologic cutaneous articular syndrome (also termed neonatal-onset multisystemic inflammatory disease). These syndromes were initially considered to be distinct disease entities despite some clinical similarities; however, mutations of the same gene have since been found in all three cryopyrinopathies. These diseases, therefore, are not separate but represent a continuum of subphenotypes. The gene in question, CIAS1 (now renamed NLRP3) encodes NALP3 (also known as cryopyrin). NALP3 is an important mediator of inflammation and interleukin 1beta processing. New therapies based on biologic agents that specifically target interleukin 1beta are currently being developed. These new agents have provided very encouraging results for patients with these long-lasting inflammatory conditions--which used to be considered refractory to treatment. The development of therapeutic options for these cryopyrinopathies illustrates effective translation of basic science to clinical practice and the convergence of human genetics and targeted therapies.},

abstract = {Gene expression is a multistep process that involves the transcription, translation and turnover of messenger RNAs and proteins. Although it is one of the most fundamental processes of life, the entire cascade has never been quantified on a genome-wide scale. Here we simultaneously measured absolute mRNA and protein abundance and turnover by parallel metabolic pulse labelling for more than 5,000 genes in mammalian cells. Whereas mRNA and protein levels correlated better than previously thought, corresponding half-lives showed no correlation. Using a quantitative model we have obtained the first genome-scale prediction of synthesis rates of mRNAs and proteins. We find that the cellular abundance of proteins is predominantly controlled at the level of translation. Genes with similar combinations of mRNA and protein stability shared functional properties, indicating that half-lives evolved under energetic and dynamic constraints. Quantitative information about all stages of gene expression provides a rich resource and helps to provide a greater understanding of the underlying design principles.},

abstract = {Suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS) proteins are inhibitors of cytokine signalling pathways. Studies have shown that SOCS proteins are key physiological regulators of both innate and adaptive immunity. These molecules positively and negatively regulate macrophage and dendritic-cell activation and are essential for T-cell development and differentiation. Evidence is also emerging of the involvement of SOCS proteins in diseases of the immune system. In this Review we bring together data from recent studies on SOCS proteins and their role in immunity, and propose a cohesive model of how cytokine signalling regulates immune-cell function.},

abstract = {Whereas interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a proinflammatory cytokine, IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine. Although signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is essential for the function of both IL-6 and IL-10, it is unclear how these two cytokines have such opposing functions. Here we show that suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) is a key regulator of the divergent action of these two cytokines. In macrophages lacking the Socs3 gene or carrying a mutation of the SOCS3-binding site in gp130, the lipopolysaccharide-induced production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-12 is suppressed by both IL-10 and IL-6. SOCS3 specifically prevents activation of STAT3 by IL-6 but not IL-10. Taken together, these data indicate that SOCS3 selectively blocks signaling by IL-6, thereby preventing its ability to inhibit LPS signaling.},

abstract = {Inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes that activate caspase-1, which leads to maturation of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 1$\beta$ (IL-1$\beta$) and IL-18 and the induction of pyroptosis. Members of the Nod-like receptor (NLR) family, including NLRP1, NLRP3 and NLRC4, and the cytosolic receptor AIM2 are critical components of inflammasomes and link microbial and endogenous danger signals to the activation of caspase-1. In response to microbial infection, activation of the inflammasomes contributes to host protection by inducing immune responses that limit microbial invasion, but deregulated activation of inflammasomes is associated with autoinflammatory syndromes and other pathologies. Thus, understanding inflammasome pathways may provide insight into the mechanisms of host defense against microbes and the development of inflammatory disorders.},

@article{Gabay2010b,
abstract = {Interleukin (IL)-1 was first cloned in the 1980s, and rapidly emerged as a key player in the regulation of inflammatory processes. The term IL-1 refers to two cytokines, IL-1alpha and IL-1beta, which are encoded by two separate genes. The effects of IL-1 are tightly controlled by several naturally occurring inhibitors, such as IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), IL-1 receptor type II (IL-1RII), and other soluble receptors. Numerous IL-1 inhibitors have been developed and tested primarily in rheumatoid arthritis, with only modest effects. By contrast, the use of IL-1 antagonists has been uniformly associated with beneficial effects in patients with hereditary autoinflammatory conditions associated with excessive IL-1 signaling, such as cryopyrinopathies and IL-1Ra deficiency. Successful treatment with IL-1 blockers has also been reported in other hereditary autoinflammatory diseases, as well as in nonhereditary inflammatory diseases, such as Schnizler syndrome, systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis and adult Still disease. The role of microcrystals in the regulation of IL-1beta processing and release has provided the rationale for the use of IL-1 inhibitors in crystal-induced arthritis. Finally, preliminary results indicating that IL-1 targeting is efficacious in type 2 diabetes and smoldering myeloma have further broadened the spectrum of IL-1-driven diseases.},
