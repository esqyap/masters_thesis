abstract = {Medulloblastomas (MB) are the most common malignant brain tumors in childhood. Alkylator-based drugs are effective agents in the treatment of patients with MB. In several tumors, including malignant glioma, elevated O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression levels or lack of MGMT promoter methylation have been found to be associated with resistance to alkylating chemotherapeutic agents such as temozolomide (TMZ). In this study, we examined the MGMT status of MB and central nervous system primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) cells and two large sets of primary MB. In seven MB/PNET cell lines investigated, MGMT promoter methylation was detected only in D425 human MB cells as assayed by the qualitative methylation-specific PCR and the more quantitative pyrosequencing assay. In D425 human MB cells, MGMT mRNA and protein expression was clearly lower when compared with the MGMT expression in the other MB/PNET cell lines. In MB/PNET cells, sensitivity towards TMZ and 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea (CCNU) correlated with MGMT methylation and MGMT mRNA expression. Pyrosequencing in 67 primary MB samples revealed a mean percentage of MGMT methylation of 3.7-92{\%} (mean: 13.25{\%}, median: 10.67{\%}). Percentage of MGMT methylation and MGMT mRNA expression as determined by quantitative RT-PCR correlated inversely (n = 46; Pearson correlation r (2) = 0.14, P = 0.01). We then analyzed MGMT mRNA expression in a second set of 47 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded primary MB samples from clinically well-documented patients treated within the prospective randomized multicenter trial HIT'91. No association was found between MGMT mRNA expression and progression-free or overall survival. Therefore, it is not currently recommended to use MGMT mRNA expression analysis to determine who should receive alkylating agents and who should not.},

abstract = {During progression from tumour growth to metastasis, specific integrin signals enable cancer cells to detach from neighbouring cells, re-orientate their polarity during migration, and survive and proliferate in foreign microenvironments. There is increasing evidence that certain integrins associate with receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) to activate signalling pathways that are necessary for tumour invasion and metastasis. The effect of these integrins might be especially important in cancer cells that have activating mutations, or amplifications, of the genes that encode these RTKs.},

abstract = {Chemotherapeutic drug resistance in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a significant problem, resulting in poor responsiveness to first-line treatment or relapse after transient remission. Classical anti-leukemic drugs are non-specific cell cycle poisons; some more modern drugs target oncogenic pathways in leukemia cells, although in ALL these do not play a very significant role. By contrast, the molecular interactions between microenvironment and leukemia cells are often neglected in the design of novel therapies against drug resistant leukemia. It was shown however, that chemotherapy resistance is promoted in part through cell-cell contact of leukemia cells with bone marrow (BM) stromal cells, also called cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR). Incomplete response to chemotherapy results in persistence of resistant clones with or without detectable minimal residual disease (MRD). Approaches for how to address CAM-DR and MRD remain elusive. Specifically, studies using anti-functional antibodies and genetic models have identified integrin alpha4 as a critical molecule regulating BM homing and active retention of normal and leukemic cells. Pre-clinical evidence has been provided that interference with alpha4-mediated adhesion of ALL cells can sensitize them to chemotherapy and thus facilitate eradication of ALL cells in an MRD setting. To this end, Andreeff and colleagues recently provided evidence of stroma-induced and alpha4-mediated nuclear factor-$\kappa$B signaling in leukemia cells, disruption of which depletes leukemia cells of strong survival signals. We here review the available evidence supporting the targeting of alpha4 as a novel strategy for treatment of drug resistant leukemia.},

abstract = {EGF receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitors, including gefitinib and erlotinib, exert potent therapeutic efficacy in non-small cell lung cancers harboring EGFR-activating mutations. However, most patients ultimately develop resistance to these drugs. Here, we report a novel mechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors and the reversal of which could improve clinical outcomes. In erlotinib-resistant lung cancer cells harboring activating EGFR mutations that we established, there was increased expression of Src, integrin $\beta$1, $\alpha$2, and $\alpha$5 along with enhanced cell adhesion activity. Interestingly, RNAi-mediated silencing of integrin $\beta$1 restored erlotinib sensitivity and reduced activation of Src and Akt after erlotinib treatment. Furthermore, Src silencing inhibited Akt phosphorylation and cell growth, with this inhibitory effect further augmented by erlotinib treatment. Increased expression of integrin $\beta$1, $\alpha$5, and/or $\alpha$2 was also observed in refractory tumor samples from patients with lung cancer treated with erlotinib and/or gefitinib. Together, our findings identify the integrin $\beta$1/Src/Akt signaling pathway as a key mediator of acquired resistance to EGFR-targeted anticancer drugs.},

abstract = {Acquired drug resistance continues to be one of the major obstacles hindering the successful treatment of many forms of cancer. Compounds utilized as antagonists of these cytoprotective mechanisms have, for the most part, proven to be ineffective at overcoming clinical resistance to cytotoxic drugs. Recently, the tumor cell microenvironment has been found to have a significant bearing on the survival of tumor cells following exposure to a wide variety of anti-neoplastic agents, prior to the acquisition of known drug resistance mechanisms. Specifically, interactions between cell surface integrins and extracellular matrix components have been shown to be responsible for this phenomenon of innate drug resistance, which we have termed Cell Adhesion Mediated Drug Resistance, or CAM-DR. Following its discovery using a multiple myeloma cell line model, evidence for CAM-DR has been found in a multitude of other human tumor cell types. In contrast to many other drug resistance mechanisms, integrin-mediated cell signaling is capable of protecting against death induced by an extremely wide variety of structurally and functionally diverse agents from traditional DNA damaging agents to the promising novel kinase inhibitor STI-571. This review examines the role of integrins in regard to their ability to protect tumor cells from drug- and radiation-induced apoptosis through numerous intracellular mechanisms. Current and future antagonists of specific integrin heterodimers may have the potential to sensitize tumor cells when used in combination with standard chemotherapy regimens. Specific signal transduction pathways initiated by integrin ligation will also be discussed as potential bridge points for inhibiting cell survival during cytotoxic drug exposure.},

For this reason, elucidation of mechanisms that confer simultaneous resistance to different drugs with different targets and chemical structures - multidrug resistance - has been a major goal of cancer biologists during the past 35 years. Here, we review the most common of these mechanisms, one that relies on drug efflux from cancer cells mediated by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. We describe various approaches to combating multidrug-resistant cancer, including the development of drugs that engage, evade or exploit efflux by ABC transporters.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: A phase I trial of the antiangiogenesis agent cilengitide (EMD 121974), an alpha v beta 3,5 integrin antagonist, was performed to estimate the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and describe dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and the incidence and severity of other toxicities when administered to children with refractory brain tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-one assessable patients received intravenous cilengitide over 1 hour twice a week for up to 52 weeks at dosages from 120 to 2,400 mg/m(2). Serial blood and urine samples for clinical pharmacology studies were obtained in a subset of consenting patients. RESULTS: No DLTs were observed, and thus, the MTD was not estimated. Three of 13 patients at the dosage level of 2,400 mg/m(2) experienced grade 3 or 4 intratumoral hemorrhage (ITH) possibly related to the study drug; however, two of the ITH events were asymptomatic and, by the current toxicity criteria, would be classified as grade 1. For patients treated at cilengitide 2,400 mg/m(2), the 6-month cumulative incidence estimate of ITH is 23{\%} (SE = 13{\%}). No ITH was observed at 1,800 mg/m(2). Three patients completed 1 year of protocol therapy; one patient with glioblastoma multiforme demonstrated complete response, and two patients had stable disease (SD). An additional patient had SD for more than 5 months. CONCLUSION: The phase II dosage of intravenous cilengitide in children with refractory brain tumors is 1,800 mg/m(2). A phase II trial to assess the efficacy of cilengitide therapy for children with refractory brain tumors is being developed by the Children's Oncology Group.},

abstract = {Production of type IV collagenase by tumor cells has been linked to their metastatic potential in several experimental models. A possible role for this enzyme in basement membrane type IV collagen turnover has also been suggested. Two recently developed affinity-purified, monospecific antibodies directed against the amino terminus (H1), or an internal active site domain (metal binding region [MBR]) of human type IV collagenase, were employed in the avidin-biotin-immunoperoxidase technique in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded breast tissue samples from 55 patients. Intense cytoplasmic immunostaining of myoepithelial cells was found in normal and hyperplastic tissue, and discontinuous staining was noted in intraductal carcinomas. Luminal epithelial cells were negative or weakly positive in large- or medium-sized ducts but reacted frequently in normal terminal ducts and hyperplastic lesions. Epithelial cells in intraductal carcinomas exhibited immunoreactivity in 20 of 23 cases. Invasive carcinomas were positive in 36 of 40 cases, and metastatic cells in lymph nodes stained in 10 of 12 cases. These results support a role for type IV collagenase in the basement membrane remodeling of normal breast. Our findings suggest that myoepithelial cells play a pivotal role in this enzymatic activity. The high percentage of positive cells in invasive carcinomas and the strong immunoreactivity of lymph node metastases support the role of the enzyme in tumor invasion and metastasis and suggest that tumor cells are the essential source of the enzyme in these processes.},

These analyses indicated that pulmonary arrest does not occur merely due to size restriction, and raised the question of how the tumor cell alpha3beta1 integrin contacts its best-defined ligand, laminin (LN)-5, a basement membrane (BM) component. Further analyses revealed that LN-5 is available to the tumor cell in preexisting patches of exposed BM in the pulmonary vasculature. The early arrest of tumor cells in the pulmonary vasculature through interaction of alpha3beta1 integrin with LN-5 in exposed BM provides both a molecular and a structural basis for cell arrest during pulmonary metastasis.},

Patients' prognosis is poor and neuropathological markers that reliably predict outcome are still missing. In a series of 104 MBs including 80 tumours of the classical and 24 tumours of the desmoplastic variant we studied the number of apoptotic figures and the expression of the proto-oncogene bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic protein known to affect tumour cell proliferation. We observed a strong correlation between the expression of bcl-2 with patients' age (P {\textless} 0.001) as well as with the desmoplastic subtype (P {\textless} 0.001). Here, protein expression was found to be restricted to internodular, less differentiated, highly proliferative areas. In classical MB, bcl-2 was detected only in 23{\%} of cases and was highly inversely correlated with the expression of synaptophysin (P {\textless} 0.001) indicating that bcl-2 is predominantly expressed by undifferentiated classical MB. With regard to prognosis the expression of bcl-2 tended to correlate with poor outcome in classical MB but not in desmoplastic MB, although not to a statistically significant extension (P = 0.06). On the other hand, a high number of apoptotic figures in the tumour tissue was found to indicate poor prognosis independent of the histological subtype (P {\textless} 0.05).},

abstract = {Medulloblastoma is the most frequent malignant brain tumor in children and is considered to be of neuroectodermal origin. Two main representative cell lines, DAOY and D283, are widely used in studies of medulloblastoma. The former shows expression of neuronal and glial elements whereas the latter is assigned to neuronal lineages. We decided to systematically study the proteome of these cell lines in order to find novel and known proteins that could serve as candidate markers or could be of interest as specific antigens for future vaccines. We studied DAOY and D283 by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis with subsequent matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization identification. A series of identified medulloblastoma proteins were already described in many other malignancies of different origin. An antiapoptotic principle, Ded protein, was observed in both cell lines. Several hypothetical proteins, that were never described at the protein level but only predicted from nucleic acid sequences, could be identified. We conclude that medulloblastoma proteins SYT interacting protein, similar to glucose related protein 58 kDa, hypothetical 37.5 kDa protein, serologically defined colon cancer antigen 10, hepatocellular carcinoma-associated antigen 59, X-ray repair complementing defective repair in CHO 5, hypothetical protein Q96ir7, nit protein 2 and hypothetical protein Q96e67, have been described in a series of other malignancies possibly indicating a role for those in tumor biology and pathomechanisms. The antiapoptotic principle, Ded protein, found in both cell lineages may stand for immortalization but could also determine malignancy per se in medulloblastoma.},

METHODS: After resection, patients were classified as having average-risk medulloblastoma ({\textless} or = 1.5 cm2 residual tumour and no metastatic disease) or high-risk medulloblastoma ({\textgreater} 1.5 cm2 residual disease or metastatic disease localised to neuraxis) medulloblastoma. All patients received risk-adapted craniospinal radiotherapy (23.4 Gy for average-risk disease and 36.0-39.6 Gy for high-risk disease) followed by four cycles of cyclophosphamide-based, dose-intensive chemotherapy. Patients were assessed regularly for disease status and treatment side-effects. The primary endpoint was 5-year event-free survival; we also measured overall survival. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00003211.

FINDINGS: Of 134 children with medulloblastoma who underwent treatment (86 average-risk, 48 high-risk), 119 (89{\%}) completed the planned protocol. No treatment-related deaths occurred. 5-year overall survival was 85{\%} (95{\%} CI 75-94) in patients in the average-risk group and 70{\%} (54-84) in those in the high-risk group (p=0.04); 5-year event-free survival was 83{\%} (73-93) and 70{\%} (55-85), respectively (p=0.046). For the 116 patients whose histology was reviewed centrally, histological subtype correlated with 5-year event-free survival (p=0.04): 84{\%} (74-95) for classic histology, 77{\%} (49-100) for desmoplastic tumours, and 57{\%} (33-80) for large-cell anaplastic tumours.

INTERPRETATION: Risk-adapted radiotherapy followed by a shortened schedule of dose-intensive chemotherapy can be used to improve the outcome of patients with high-risk medulloblastoma.},

@article{Guadamillas2011b,
abstract = {Anoikis (or cell-detachment-induced apoptosis) is a self-defense strategy that organisms use to eliminate ‘misplaced' cells, i.e. cells that are in an inappropriate location. Occasionally, detached or misplaced cells can overcome anoikis and survive for a certain period of time in the absence of the correct signals from the extracellular matrix (ECM). If cells are able to adapt to their new environment, then they have probably become anchorage-independent, which is one of the hallmarks of cancer cells. Anoikis resistance and anchorage-independency allow tumor cells to expand and invade adjacent tissues, and to disseminate through the body, giving rise to metastasis. Thus, overcoming anoikis is a crucial step in a series of changes that a tumor cell undergoes during malignant transformation. Tumor cells have developed a variety of strategies to bypass or overcome anoikis. Some strategies consist of adaptive cellular changes that allow the cells to behave as they would in the correct environment, so that induction of anoikis is aborted. Other strategies aim to counteract the negative effects of anoikis induction by hyperactivating survival and proliferative cascades. The recently discovered processes of autophagy and entosis also highlight the contribution of these mechanisms to rendering the cells in a dormant state until they receive a signal initiated at the ECM, thereby circumventing anoikis. In all situations, the final outcome is the ability of the tumor to grow and metastasize. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying anoikis resistance could help to counteract tumor progression and prevent metastasis formation.},

Immunohistochemical studies showed that both cell lines possessed 145 and 200 kDa neurofilament proteins and neuron-specific enolase, without glial fibrillary acidic protein and S-100 protein. It was shown that interferon gamma could enhance or induce the expression of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens which play a major role in immune response.

abstract = {The development of a drug-resistant cell line can take from 3 to 18 months. However, little is published on the methodology of this development process. This article will discuss key decisions to be made prior to starting resistant cell line development; the choice of parent cell line, dose of selecting agent, treatment interval, and optimizing the dose of drug for the parent cell line. Clinically relevant drug-resistant cell lines are developed by mimicking the conditions cancer patients experience during chemotherapy and cell lines display between two- and eight-fold resistance compared to their parental cell line. Doses of drug administered are low, and a pulsed treatment strategy is often used where the cells recover in drug-free media. High-level laboratory models are developed with the aim of understanding potential mechanisms of resistance to chemotherapy agents. Doses of drug are higher and escalated over time. It is common to have difficulty developing stable clinically relevant drug-resistant cell lines. A comparative selection strategy of multiple cell lines or multiple chemotherapeutic agents mitigates this risk and gives insight into which agents or type of cell line develops resistance easily. Successful selection strategies from our research are presented. Pulsed-selection produced platinum or taxane-resistant large cell lung cancer (H1299 and H460) and temozolomide-resistant melanoma (Malme-3M and HT144) cell lines. Continuous selection produced a lapatinib-resistant breast cancer cell line (HCC1954). Techniques for maintaining drug-resistant cell lines are outlined including; maintaining cells with chemotherapy, pulse treating with chemotherapy, or returning to master drug-resistant stocks. The heterogeneity of drug-resistant models produced from the same parent cell line with the same chemotherapy agent is explored with reference to P-glycoprotein. Heterogeneity in drug-resistant cell lines reflects the heterogeneity that can occur in clinical drug resistance.},

abstract = {Medulloblastomas are the most common malignant brain tumors in childhood. Emerging evidence suggests that medulloblastoma comprises at least four distinct diseases (WNT, SHH, Group 3 and 4) with different biology, clinical presentation, and outcome, with especially poor prognosis in Group 3. The tight connection of biology and clinical behavior in patients emphasizes the need for subgroup-specific preclinical models in order to develop treatments tailored to each subgroup. Herein we report on the novel cell line HD-MB03, isolated from tumor material of a patient with metastasized Group 3 medulloblastoma, and preclinical testing of different histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) in this model. HD-MB03 cells grow long term in vitro and form metastatic tumors in vivo upon orthotopic transplantation. HD-MB03 cells reflect the original Group 3 medulloblastoma at the histological and molecular level, showing large cell morphology, similar expression patterns for markers Ki67, p53, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a gene expression profile most closely matching Group 3 medulloblastomas, and persistence of typical molecular alterations, i.e., isochromosome 17q [i(17q)] and MYC amplification. Protein expression analysis of HDACs 2, 5, 8, and 9 as well as the predictive marker HR23B showed intermediate to strong expression, suggesting sensitivity to HDACis. Indeed, treatment with HDACis Helminthosporium carbonum (HC)-toxin, vorinostat, and panobinostat revealed high sensitivity to this novel drug class, as well as a radiation-sensitizing effect with significantly increased cell death upon concomitant treatment. In summary, our data indicate that HD-MB03 is a suitable preclinical model for Group 3 medulloblastoma, and HDACis could represent a therapeutic option for this subgroup.},

abstract = {A pharmacologic approach to male contraception remains a longstanding challenge in medicine. Toward this objective, we explored the spermatogenic effects of a selective small-molecule inhibitor (JQ1) of the bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) subfamily of epigenetic reader proteins. Here, we report potent inhibition of the testis-specific member BRDT, which is essential for chromatin remodeling during spermatogenesis. Biochemical and crystallographic studies confirm that occupancy of the BRDT acetyl-lysine binding pocket by JQ1 prevents recognition of acetylated histone H4. Treatment of mice with JQ1 reduced seminiferous tubule area, testis size, and spermatozoa number and motility without affecting hormone levels. Although JQ1-treated males mate normally, inhibitory effects of JQ1 evident at the spermatocyte and round spermatid stages cause a complete and reversible contraceptive effect. These data establish a new contraceptive that can cross the blood:testis boundary and inhibit bromodomain activity during spermatogenesis, providing a lead compound targeting the male germ cell for contraception.

abstract = {Orthotopic brain tumor growth is inhibited in athymic mice by the daily systemic administration of the alpha v-integrin antagonist EMD 121974. This compound, a cyclic RGD-penta-peptide, is a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis, which induces apoptosis of growing endothelial cells through inhibition of their alpha v-integrin interaction with the matrix proteins vitronectin and tenascin. Here we show that EMD 121974 also induces apoptosis in the alpha v-integrin-expressing tumor cell lines U87 MG and DAOY by detaching them from vitronectin and tenascin, matrix proteins known to be essential for brain tumor growth and invasion. These matrix proteins are shown to be produced by the brain tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, only tumor cells expressing alpha v-integrins responded to the treatment with EMD 121974, after xenotransplantation into the forebrain of nude mice, supporting the importance of tumor cell-matrix interactions in tumor cell survival in the brain. Thus, the alpha v-antagonist EMD 121974 suppresses brain tumor growth through induction of apoptosis in both brain capillary and brain tumor cells by preventing their interaction with the matrix proteins vitronectin and tenascin. The dual action of this peptide explains its potent growth suppression of orthotopically transplanted brain tumors.},

abstract = {Local recurrence continues to limit survival in medulloblastoma patients, largely related to the persistence of invasive cells at the site of tumour resection and leptomeningeal dissemination. Given the relative dearth of understanding of causative mechanisms behind the invasiveness of medulloblastomas, and a general lack of validated in vitro models with which to study them, our objectives were (1) to obtain quantitative data on the invasiveness of five distinct medulloblastoma cell lines within a 3-dimensional in vitro collagen-based model; and (2) to characterize some of the mechanisms behind invasion, specifically striving to identify proteolytic processes that occur as medulloblastoma cells disrupt and thereby invade the normal tissue surrounding them, and specific inhibitors of these proteolytic enzymes. Five different medulloblastoma cell lines (UW228-1, 2 and 3; Daoy, and Madsen) were implanted onto a 3-dimensional, type I collagen gel assay to assess tumour invasion distance and mean doubling time over 5 days. Proteolytic activity was assessed against collagen types I and IV by measuring the degradation of 3H-collagen I and IV to products soluble in 100{\%} w/v trichloroacetic acid; and general (neutral) proteolytic activity evaluated by measuring the degradation of 3H-albumin. In other experiments, cells were pre-exposed to a variety of protease inhibitors, including inhibitors of metalloproteinases and cysteine, serine and aspartic proteases, and then plated to identify any inhibition of invasion. Inter-group differences in mean invasion distance were assessed by means of Student's t-tests for non-paired subjects, with P {\textless} 0.05 set as the threshold for statistical significance. For the inhibitor studies, an inhibition index, called the inhibitory concentration 50, IC-50, was calculated by performing a regression analysis for each inhibitor tested over a range of concentrations, for each cell line. Within hours of implantation, individual cells readily detached from the surface of the cell aggregates and invaded the collagen matrix, to distances of up to 1,200 mum and at rates of up to 300-mum per day; the UW228-1 cell line clearly was less invasive than the other four cell lines. Proteolytic activity was identified against collagen type I, but not against collagen type IV or albumin; but there was no apparent correlation between invasion distance and either cell doubling time or the amount of collagen type I proteolytic activity. Both metalloproteinase inhibitors suppressed tumour invasion, as did one of two cysteine protease inhibitors; but there was no tumour suppression with either serine or aspartic protease inhibition. MMP-1 and 2, and TIMP-1 and 2 all were detectable by Western blot analysis. Medulloblastoma cell invasiveness within the 3-dimensional model used here appears to depend upon a combination of metalloproteinase and cysteine protease activity, a finding that may suggest areas for potential future clinical investigation and therapy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The treatment of previously irradiated patients with recurrent central nervous system primitive neuroectodermal tumours (PNETs) is a considerable challenge. A study was undertaken to attempt to improve the outcome for such patients using a high dose chemotherapy (HDCT) based strategy.

METHODS: Between 2000 and 2007, 40 patients with relapsed medulloblastoma (MB) and 5 with relapsed supratentorial PNETs (StPNETs) were accrued. All but one had received prior craniospinal radiotherapy. Patients were initially treated with cyclophosphamide (4 g/m(2)) together with surgery or local radiotherapy where appropriate. If complete or near complete remission was achieved, the patient proceeded to receive two sequential courses of HDCT with stem cell rescue. The first course consisted of thiotepa (900 mg/m(2)) and the second carboplatin (AUC 21).

RESULTS: All five patients with StPNET died of tumour progression with a median OS of 0.4 years. Nineteen of the 40 patients with relapsed MB underwent surgery. Radiotherapy was administered to eight patients. All patients received at least one course of cyclophosphamide. Only 22 MB patients progressed to the HDCT phase; 10 patients received thiotepa only and 12 thiotepa and carboplatin. At a median follow-up of 7.4 years (Range 2.8-8.2 years), only three MB patients are still alive, one following a further relapse. Three and 5 year OS was 22.0{\%} and 8.2{\%}, respectively and 3 and 5 year EFS was 14.6{\%} and 8.7{\%}, respectively.

CONCLUSION: This national study based on a strategy including a particular tandem HDCT regimen showed no benefit for previously irradiated patients with relapsed StPNET and very limited benefit for patients with relapsed medulloblastoma.},

abstract = {CDX2 is a Drosophila caudal-related homeobox transcription factor that is important for the establishment and maintenance of intestinal epithelial cells. CDX2 is a marker of colon cancer, with strong staining in up to 90{\%} of colonic adenocarcinomas. CDX2 heterozygous-null mice develop colonic neoplasms, which have suggested that CDX2 is a tumor suppressor. However, CDX2 has not been reported to affect xenograft growth. Furthermore, CDX2 is rarely mutated in colon cancer, which has led to suggestions that it may play only a minor role as a tumor suppressor in colon cancer. To understand the functional contributions of CDX2 to colon cancer, we disrupted CDX2 in LOVO and SW48 human colon cancer cell lines by targeted homologous recombination. Consistent with the literature, disruption of CDX2 enhanced anchorage-dependent cell proliferation. However, homozygous loss of CDX2 led to significant inhibition of anchorage-independent growth in LOVO cells, and cell lethality in SW48 cells. Further analyses revealed that disruption of CDX2 led to anchorage-independent G1 to S growth arrest and anoikis. In vivo xenograft studies confirmed that disruption of CDX2 inhibited LOVO tumor growth. These data demonstrate that CDX2 mediates anchorage-independent growth and survival. Thus, CDX2 has tumorigenic potential in the human colon cancer cell lines LOVO and SW48.},

abstract = {Although primary treatment of medulloblastoma is now successful in a high percentage of patients, its secondary manifestations still bear a poor prognosis. Thorough studies of secondary manifestations are therefore pivotal to plan therapeutic approaches for the long-term management of medulloblastoma. Here we describe the incidence of secondary tumour manifestations in 66 patients of a single centre who underwent surgery for medulloblastoma between 1975 and 1990. No patient was excluded due to a poor postoperative course. Thirty-five patients showed evidence of secondary tumour growth. Of these, 17 suffered from local recurrence, and 27 developed metastastatic disease. The median latencies for secondary manifestations were 25 months for local recurrence (n = 17), 11 months for spinal metastases (n = 10), 15 months for supratentorial metastases (n = 8), 8 months for subleptomeningeal dissemination (n = 6), and 23 months for systemic metastases (n = 8). Two patients developed primary metastatic spread to the posterior fossa. Of 8 patients with supratentorial metastases, 6 developed fronto-basal lesions. In our patients, 89{\%} of secondary lesions occurred within less than 3 years after primary diagnosis. 85{\%} of patients with extra-axial tumour spread had been treated with a permanent shunt. Radical tumour resection and radiotherapy with 30 Gy to the neuraxis and 20 Gy boost to the posterior fossa was an important prognostic factor in this series. Patients with additional chemotherapy did not benefit significantly from this treatment. We conclude that optimal management of the primary lesions should aim at (i) total resection, (ii) avoid permanent shunting, and (iii) completion of the radiotherapy with inclusion of the medial frontobasal cisterns in the radiotherapeutic regimen. Our analysis suggests that adequate postoperative screening programmes should consist of 3-monthly scans of the neuraxis in the first three postoperative years and 6-monthly scans thereafter.},

abstract = {BackgroundCilengitide, an v integrin antagonist, has demonstrated activity in recurrent adult glioblastoma (GBM). The Children's Oncology Group ACNS0621 study thus evaluated whether cilengitide is active as a single agent in the treatment of children with refractory high-grade glioma (HGG). Secondary objectives were to investigate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics of cilengitide in this population.MethodsCilengitide (1800 mg/m2/dose intravenous) was administered twice weekly until evidence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Thirty patients (age range, 1.1-20.3 years) were enrolled, of whom 24 were evaluable for the primary response end point.ResultsToxicity was infrequent and mild, with the exception of one episode of grade 2 pain possibly related to cilengitide. Two intratumoral hemorrhages were reported, but only one (grade 2) was deemed to be possibly related to cilengitide and was in the context of disease progression. One patient with GBM received cilengitide for 20 months and remains alive with continuous stable disease. There were no other responders, with median time to tumor progression of 28 days (range, 11-114 days). Twenty-one of the 24 evaluable patients died, with a median time from enrollment to death of 172 days (range, 28-325 days). The 3 patients alive at the time of this report had a follow-up time of 37, 223, and 1068 days, respectively.ConclusionsWe conclude that cilengitide is not effective as a single agent for refractory pediatric HGG. However, further study evaluating combination therapy with cilengitide is warranted before a role for cilengitide in the treatment of pediatric HGG can be excluded. {\textcopyright} 2013 {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2013.

abstract = {Although integrin $\alpha$v$\beta$3 is linked to cancer progression, its role in epithelial development is unclear. Here, we show that $\alpha$v$\beta$3 plays a critical role in adultmammary stem cells (MaSCs) during pregnancy. Whereas $\alpha$v$\beta$3 is a luminal progenitor marker in thevirgin gland, we noted increased $\alpha$v$\beta$3 expression in MaSCs at midpregnancy. Accordingly, mice lacking $\alpha$v$\beta$3 or expressing a signaling-deficient receptor showed defective mammary gland morphogenesisduring pregnancy. This was associated with decreased MaSC expansion, clonogenicity, and expression of Slug, a master regulator of MaSCs. Surprisingly, $\alpha$v$\beta$3-deficient mice displayed normal development of the virgin gland with no effect on luminal progenitors. Transforming growth factor $\beta$2 (TGF-$\beta$2) induced $\alpha$v$\beta$3 expression, enhancing Slug nuclear accumulation and MaSC clonogenicity. In human breast cancer cells, $\alpha$v$\beta$3 was necessary and sufficient for Slug activation, tumorsphere formation, and tumor initiation. Thus, pregnancy-associated MaSCs require a TGF-$\beta$2/$\alpha$v$\beta$3/Slug pathway, which may contribute to breast cancer progression and stemness. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The alpha6beta4 integrin, a laminin receptor, has been implicated from many studies in tumor progression and invasion. We showed that the beta4 integrin subunit associates with the ErbB-2 tyrosine kinase in human mammary carcinoma cell lines and that its overexpression in NIH3T3/ErbB-2-transformed cells causes a constitutive activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), inducing a strong increase of their invasive capacity. In this study, we investigated the biological consequences of interference with the endogenous beta4 integrin subunit expression. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In vitro and in vivo tumor growth and the biochemical consequences of beta4 integrin inactivation were studied in mammary tumor cells by using short hairpin RNA approach. RESULTS: Our data show that tumor growth of mammary tumor cells strictly depends on beta4 expression, confirming the relevance of beta4 protein in these cells. Moreover, interference with beta4 expression significantly reduces endogenous PI3K activity and AKT and mammalian target of rapamycin phosphorylation. Accordingly, with these results and considering that PI3K activity in mammary tumor plays a relevant role in hormone resistance, we asked whether beta4 expression might be relevant for hormone responsiveness in these cells. Data reported indicate that the interference with endogenous beta4 expression, upon hormone deprivation, induces caspase-9 and cytochrome c-mediated apoptosis, which is enhanced upon tamoxifen treatment. On the other hand, the expression of myr-AKT in MCF7 beta4-short hairpin RNA cells rescues the cells from apoptosis in the absence of hormones and upon tamoxifen treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results confirm the relevance of beta4 expression in mammary tumors and indicate this integrin as a relevant target for tumor therapy.},

Since this type of apoptosis has been referred to as anoikis, we designated these cells as anoikis-positive. However, a minor proportion of Caco-2 cells, designated as anoikis-negative, survived in suspension. Extended incubation of the cells in suspension resulted in the reduction of the number of viable cells. In comparison to the original Caco-2 cell population, the anoikis-negative cells demonstrated markedly decreased levels of expression of integrin alphavbeta3 on the cell surface and of transcription of the alphav subunit gene. Activation of the signaling function of alphavbeta3 in the original Caco-2 cells led to substantial stimulation of anoikis, while the inhibition of expression of this receptor resulted in better resistance of the cells to anoikis. The data provide the first evidence that alphavbeta3 integrin can generate apoptosis-stimulating signals.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: With current treatment strategies, nearly half of all medulloblastoma (MB) patients die from progressive tumors. Accordingly, the identification of novel therapeutic strategies remains a major goal. Deregulation of c-MYC is evident in numerous human cancers. In MB, over-expression of c-MYC has been shown to cause anaplasia and correlate with unfavorable prognosis. METHODS: To study the role of c-MYC in MB biology, we down-regulated c-MYC expression by using small interfering RNA (siRNA) and investigated changes in cellular proliferation, cell cycle analysis, apoptosis, telomere maintenance, and response to ionizing radiation (IR) and chemotherapeutics in a representative panel of human MB cell lines expressing different levels of c-MYC (DAOY wild-type, DAOY transfected with the empty vector, DAOY transfected with c-MYC, D341, and D425). RESULTS: siRNA-mediated c-MYC down-regulation resulted in an inhibition of cellular proliferation and clonogenic growth, inhibition of G1-S phase cell cycle progression, and a decrease in human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) expression and telomerase activity. On the other hand, down-regulation of c-MYC reduced apoptosis and decreased the sensitivity of human MB cells to IR, cisplatin, and etoposide. This effect was more pronounced in DAOY cells expressing high levels of c-MYC when compared with DAOY wild-type or DAOY cells transfected with the empty vector. CONCLUSION: In human MB cells, in addition to its roles in growth and proliferation, c-MYC is also a potent inducer of apoptosis. Therefore, targeting c-MYC might be of therapeutic benefit when used sequentially with chemo- and radiotherapy rather than concomitantly.},

MB cell lines, grown in adherence and as spheres, were subjected to morphologic analysis at the light and electron microscopic level, as well as cytofluorimetric determinations. Medullospheres (MBS) were shown to express increasingly immature features, along with the stem cells markers: CD133, Nestin and $\beta$-catenin. Proteomic analysis highlighted the differences between MB cell lines, demonstrating a unique protein profile for each cell line, and minor differences when grown as spheres. In MBS, MALDI-TOF also identified some proteins, that have been linked to tumor progression and resistance, such as Nucleophosmin (NPM). In addition, immunocytochemistry detected Sox-2 as a stemness marker of MBS, as well as confirming high NPM expression.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Culture conditioning based on low attachment flasks and specialized medium may provide new data on the staminal compartment of CNS tumors, although a proteomic profile of CSC is still elusive for MB.},

Frequently, literature presents studies in monolayer cell cultures, 3D cell cultures or in vivo studies, but rarely the same work compares results of drug resistance in different models. Several of these works are presented in this review and show that usually cells in 3D culture are more resistant to drugs than monolayer cultured cells due to different mechanisms. Searching for new strategies to sensitize different tumors to chemotherapy, many methods have been studied to understand the mechanisms whereby cancer cells acquire drug resistance. These methods have been strongly advanced along the years and therapies using different drugs have been increasingly proposed to induce cell death in resistant cells of different cancers. Recently, cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been extensively studied because they would be the only cells capable of sustaining tumorigenesis. It is believed that the resistance of CSCs to currently used chemotherapeutics is a major contributing factor in cancer recurrence and later metastasis development. This review aims to appraise the experimental progress in the study of acquired drug resistance of cancer cells in different models as well as to understand the role of CSCs as the major contributing factor in cancer recurrence and metastasis development, describing how CSCs can be identified and isolated.},

The compound JQ1 inhibits BET bromodomain-containing proteins, including BRD4. Here, we investigate BET bromodomain targeting for the treatment of MYC-amplified medulloblastoma.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We evaluated the effects of genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of BET bromodomains on proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis in established and newly generated patient- and genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM)-derived medulloblastoma cell lines and xenografts that harbored amplifications of MYC or MYCN. We also assessed the effect of JQ1 on MYC expression and global MYC-associated transcriptional activity. We assessed the in vivo efficacy of JQ1 in orthotopic xenografts established in immunocompromised mice.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Treatment of MYC-amplified medulloblastoma cells with JQ1 decreased cell viability associated with arrest at G1 and apoptosis. We observed downregulation of MYC expression and confirmed the inhibition of MYC-associated transcriptional targets. The exogenous expression of MYC from a retroviral promoter reduced the effect of JQ1 on cell viability, suggesting that attenuated levels of MYC contribute to the functional effects of JQ1. JQ1 significantly prolonged the survival of orthotopic xenograft models of MYC-amplified medulloblastoma (P {\textless} 0.001).

Primary brain tumors, although not forming distant metastases, disseminate via the cerebrospinal fluid and occupy the meninges. The multistep process of cancer or bacterial dissemination is regulated through molecular crosstalk between invaders and host cells. Such crosstalks establish invasion-promoter and invasion-suppressor complexes. In carcinomatous and bacterial meningitis, the participation of host cells is prominent since leukocytes and inflammatory cytokines are the major determinants of malignancy. We propose a model in which bacterial breakdown products activate endothelial cells, a process leading to leukocyte extravasation. This initiates a cascade of inflammatory processes opening up the blood cerebrospinal fluid barrier and producing access for new invaders.},

abstract = {The constitutive activation of $\beta$-catenin signaling in the mammary basal epithelial cell layer in transgenic K5$\Delta$N$\beta$cat mice leads to basal-type tumor development. Integrins of the $\beta$1 family and integrin-mediated signaling events have an important role in breast tumor growth and progression. We show here that the deletion of $\alpha$3$\beta$1 integrin, a major laminin receptor, from the basal layer of the mammary epithelium of K5$\Delta$N$\beta$cat mice completely prevented the tumorigenesis induced by $\beta$-catenin signaling. Moreover, the depletion of $\alpha$3$\beta$1 integrin from a spontaneously transformed mouse mammary basal epithelial cell line (MEC) prevented the cells from forming colonies in soft agar and greatly reduced tumor development in orthotopic grafts. Inhibition of the integrin signaling intermediates Rac1 or PAK1 (P21-activated Kinase 1) in MEC affected tumor cell growth in soft agar, whereas the expression of activated forms of these effectors in $\alpha$3-depleted cells rescued the capacity of these cells to grow in non-adherent conditions. Similarly, the tumorigenic potential of $\alpha$3-depleted cells was restored by the expression of activated PAK1, as assessed by orthotopic transplantation assay. In three-dimensional Matrigel culture, MEC survival and proliferation were affected by the depletion of $\alpha$3$\beta$1 integrin, which also significantly decreased the activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK). Our data suggest that the activation of signaling cascades downstream from $\alpha$3$\beta$1 and involving the Rac1/PAK1 pathway, MAPK and JNK, promotes prosurvival and proproliferative signals required for the malignant growth of basal mammary epithelial cells, providing further insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying breast cancer initiation and progression.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor of childhood. Children who relapse usually die of their disease, which reflects resistance to radiation and/or chemotherapy. Improvements in outcome require a better understanding of the molecular basis of medulloblastoma growth and treatment response. TP73 is a member of the TP53 tumor suppressor gene family that has been found to be overexpressed in a variety of tumors and mediates apoptotic responses to genotoxic stress. In this study, we assessed expression of TP73 RNA species in patient tumor specimens and in medulloblastoma cell lines, and manipulated expression of full-length TAp73 and amino-terminal truncated DeltaNp73 to assess their effects on growth. METHODS: We analyzed medulloblastoma samples from thirty-four pediatric patients and the established medulloblastoma cell lines, Daoy and D283MED, for expression of TP73 RNA including the full-length transcript and the 5'-terminal variants that encode the DeltaNp73 isoform, as well as TP53 RNA using quantitative real time-RTPCR. Protein expression of TAp73 and DeltaNp73 was quantitated with immunoblotting methods. Clinical outcome was analyzed based on TP73 RNA and p53 protein expression. To determine effects of overexpression or knock-down of TAp73 and DeltaNp73 on cell cycle and apoptosis, we analyzed transiently transfected medulloblastoma cell lines with flow cytometric and TUNEL methods. RESULTS: Patient medulloblastoma samples and cell lines expressed full-length and 5'-terminal variant TP73 RNA species in 100-fold excess compared to non-neoplastic brain controls. Western immunoblot analysis confirmed their elevated levels of TAp73 and amino-terminal truncated DeltaNp73 proteins. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed trends toward favorable overall and progression-free survival of patients whose tumors display TAp73 RNA overexpression. Overexpression of TAp73 or DeltaNp73 induced apoptosis under basal growth conditions in vitro and sensitized them to cell death in response to chemotherapeutic agents. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that primary medulloblastomas express significant levels of TP73 isoforms, and suggest that they can modulate the survival and genotoxic responsiveness of medulloblastomas cells.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine the event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival of children with average-risk medulloblastoma and treated with reduced-dose craniospinal radiotherapy (CSRT) and one of two postradiotherapy chemotherapies. METHODS: Four hundred twenty-one patients between 3 years and 21 years of age with nondisseminated medulloblastoma (MB) were prospectively randomly assigned to treatment with 23.4 Gy of CSRT, 55.8 Gy of posterior fossa RT, plus one of two adjuvant chemotherapy regimens: lomustine (CCNU), cisplatin, and vincristine; or cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, and vincristine. Results Forty-two of 421 patients enrolled were excluded from analysis. Sixty-six of the remaining 379 patients had incompletely assessable postoperative studies. Five-year EFS and survival for the cohort of 379 patients was 81{\%} +/- 2.1{\%} and 86{\%} +/- 9{\%}, respectively (median follow-up over 5 years). EFS was unaffected by sex, race, age, treatment regimen, brainstem involvement, or excessive anaplasia. EFS was detrimentally affected by neuroradiographic unassessability. Patients with areas of frank dissemination had a 5-year EFS of 36{\%} +/- 15{\%}. Sixty-seven percent of progressions had some component of dissemination. There were seven second malignancies. Infections occurred more frequently on the cyclophosphamide arm and electrolyte abnormalities were more common on the CCNU regimen. CONCLUSION: This study discloses an encouraging EFS rate for children with nondisseminated MB treated with reduced-dose craniospinal radiation and chemotherapy. Additional, careful, step-wise reductions in CSRT in adequately staged patients may be possible.},
