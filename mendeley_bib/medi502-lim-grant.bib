abstract = {The alpha5beta1 integrin represent a new therapeutic target for glioblastoma, which are malignant brain tumors difficult to cure with conventional therapies. Glioblastoma are known to be highly resistant to chemotherapy. We, therefore, investigated whether blocking alpha5beta1 integrin with specific nonpeptidic antagonists concomitantly with chemotherapy (ellipticine and temozolomide) may impact the response to chemotherapy of human glioblastoma. Here we show that inhibiting alpha5beta1 integrin with 2 selective ligands (SJ749 and K34c) decreases chemotherapy-induced premature senescence and facilitates cell apoptosis in a functional p53 background (U87MG cells). When p53 is mutated and inactive (U373 cells), chemotherapy induces p53-independent cell apoptosis instead of senescence that is not improved by integrin antagonists. Silencing p53 in U87MG cells with siRNA as well as evaluating HCT116 p53+/+ and p53-/- colon carcinoma cell behavior support the hypothesis of an as yet unknown effect of alpha5beta1 integrin antagonists on the control of chemotherapy-induced premature senescence and apoptosis. alpha5beta1 integrin antagonists modulate the p53 signaling induced by chemotherapy. Our results highlight a new role of the alpha5beta1 integrin in the control of glioblastoma aggressiveness and responsiveness to chemotherapy, which may have a crucial impact in the clinical management of patients suffering from brain tumors.},

abstract = {The development of a drug-resistant cell line can take from 3 to 18 months. However, little is published on the methodology of this development process. This article will discuss key decisions to be made prior to starting resistant cell line development; the choice of parent cell line, dose of selecting agent, treatment interval, and optimizing the dose of drug for the parent cell line. Clinically relevant drug-resistant cell lines are developed by mimicking the conditions cancer patients experience during chemotherapy and cell lines display between two- and eight-fold resistance compared to their parental cell line. Doses of drug administered are low, and a pulsed treatment strategy is often used where the cells recover in drug-free media. High-level laboratory models are developed with the aim of understanding potential mechanisms of resistance to chemotherapy agents. Doses of drug are higher and escalated over time. It is common to have difficulty developing stable clinically relevant drug-resistant cell lines. A comparative selection strategy of multiple cell lines or multiple chemotherapeutic agents mitigates this risk and gives insight into which agents or type of cell line develops resistance easily. Successful selection strategies from our research are presented. Pulsed-selection produced platinum or taxane-resistant large cell lung cancer (H1299 and H460) and temozolomide-resistant melanoma (Malme-3M and HT144) cell lines. Continuous selection produced a lapatinib-resistant breast cancer cell line (HCC1954). Techniques for maintaining drug-resistant cell lines are outlined including; maintaining cells with chemotherapy, pulse treating with chemotherapy, or returning to master drug-resistant stocks. The heterogeneity of drug-resistant models produced from the same parent cell line with the same chemotherapy agent is explored with reference to P-glycoprotein. Heterogeneity in drug-resistant cell lines reflects the heterogeneity that can occur in clinical drug resistance.},

@article{Janouskova2012b,
abstract = {Integrins play a role in the resistance of advanced cancers to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. In this study, we show that high expression of the $\alpha$5 integrin subunit compromises temozolomide-induced tumor suppressor p53 activity in human glioblastoma cells. We found that depletion of the $\alpha$5 integrin subunit increased p53 activity and temozolomide sensitivity. However, when cells were treated with the p53 activator nutlin-3a, the protective effect of $\alpha$5 integrin on p53 activation and cell survival was lost. In a functional p53 background, nutlin-3a downregulated the $\alpha$5 integrin subunit, thereby increasing the cytotoxic effect of temozolomide. Clinically, $\alpha$5$\beta$1 integrin expression was associated with a more aggressive phenotype in brain tumors, and high $\alpha$5 integrin gene expression was associated with decreased survival of patients with high-grade glioma. Taken together, our findings indicate that negative cross-talk between $\alpha$5$\beta$1 integrin and p53 supports glioma resistance to temozolomide, providing preclinical proof-of-concept that $\alpha$5$\beta$1 integrin represents a therapeutic target for high-grade brain tumors. Direct activation of p53 may remain a therapeutic option in the subset of patients with high-grade gliomas that express both functional p53 and a high level of $\alpha$5$\beta$1 integrin.},

@article{Uhm1999b,
abstract = {Vitronectin (VN) is an extracellular matrix (ECM) protein, the synthesis of which in vivo by glioma cells correlates with tumor grade. Although the role of VN as a permissive substrate for glioma migration has been well characterized, its role in conferring a survival advantage for tumor cells has not been addressed previously. By using an in vitro assay of DNA fragmentation as a quantitative measure of apoptotic cell death, we sought to determine whether the sensitivity of two human glioma cell lines (D54 and U251) to drug-induced apoptosis could be inhibited by VN. As well, the extent to which apoptosis could be inhibited was correlated with the levels of the Bcl-2 family of proteins that are known to modulate apoptosis and chemoresistance. Results of the study were: (a) VN coatings, in a dose-dependent manner, inhibited topoisomerase (Topo)-induced apoptosis by up to 50{\%} (optimal coating density, 500 ng/cm2); in contrast, fibronectin (FN), an ECM protein present in abundance in the brain, demonstrated no protection; (b) in a dose-response study, VN clearly conferred a survival advantage (LD50 of Topo: on VN, 120 ng/ml; on FN, 35 ng/ml); (c) the protective effect of VN was not due to enhanced cell adhesion or alterations in the cell cycle distribution; (d) both of the classic integrin receptors that bind VN (alpha(v)beta3, alpha(v)beta5) were capable of mediating this protective effect, because ligation of either of the two classic integrins conferred chemoresistance to Topo; and (e) chemoresistance observed with VN was associated with an increase in expression of two antiapoptotic proteins, Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L), with a consequent increase in the ratios for Bcl-2:Bax and Bcl-X(L):Bax. VN, an ECM protein preferentially expressed at the tumor-brain interface in vivo, may confer a survival advantage to glioma cells at the advancing tumor margin and may thus, in part, underlie the high level of tumor recurrence at this interface.},
