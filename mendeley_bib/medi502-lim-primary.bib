abstract = {Cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance contributes to minimal residual disease and relapse in hematological malignancies. Here, we show that adhesion of Jurkat T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells to substrates engaging $\alpha$4$\beta$1-integrin or $\alpha$5$\beta$1-integrin promotes chemoresistance to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. Reconstituted expression of $\alpha$4$\delta$, a truncated $\alpha$4-integrin with KXGFFKR as the cytoplasmic motif, in $\alpha$4-deficient cells promoted chemoresistance to doxorubicin in a manner independent of $\alpha$4-mediated adhesion. The adhesion-independent chemoresistance did not require $\beta$1-integrin as the heterodimeric pair, since expression of Tac$\delta$, a monomeric nonintegrin transmembrane protein fused to the juxtamembrane KXGFFKR, was sufficient to reproduce the phenomenon. The requirement for integrin-mediated adhesion in stimulation of Akt phosphorylation and activation was bypassed for cells expressing $\alpha$4$\delta$ and Tac$\delta$. Cells expressing $\alpha$4$\delta$ and Tac$\delta$ exhibited a high influx of extracellular Ca(2+), and inhibition of Ca(2+) channels with verapamil attenuated the adhesion-independent chemoresistance. Tac$\delta$ cells also exhibited greater rates of drug efflux. $\alpha$4$\delta$ and Tac$\delta$ interacted with the Ca(2+)-binding protein calreticulin, in a manner dependent on the KXGFFKR motif. Adhesion-mediated engagement of $\alpha$4-integrins promoted an increased calreticulin-$\alpha$4 association and greater influx of extracellular Ca(2+) than in nonadherent cells. The $\alpha$-integrin KXGFFKR motif is involved in adhesion-mediated control of chemoresistance in T cells.},

abstract = {Background: Greater than 70{\%} of patients diagnosed with medulloblastoma today are cured. However, salvage therapy after recurrence remains widely varied. Survival after recurrence of medulloblastoma has not been reported in an unselected cohort of patients in the contemporary era. Methods: With approval of the Institutional Review Board, medical records were reviewed for 55 patients diagnosed with medulloblastoma between 2000 and 2010, and treated at Seattle Children's Hospital, the largest pediatric cancer center in the Pacific Northwest, with referrals from Washington, Alaska, Montana, Idaho and Wyoming. Forty-seven children over the age of three at initial diagnosis were considered for this analysis. The following variables were collected for patients diagnosed with recurrent or progressive disease: age at diagnosis, gender, stage, histology, time to relapse, site of relapse, treatment after relapse, and time to death or last contact. Survival was described according to the method of Kaplan and Meier and comparisons were made using the log rank test. Results: Fourteen of 47 patients (30{\%}) experienced recurrent or progressive medulloblastoma. The median age at diagnosis was 9 years (range 5.8 to 15.9), and 71{\%} (n=10) were male. Most patients had localized disease (M0, 78.6{\%}), classic histology (78.6{\%}) and gross total resection (92.9{\%}) at initial diagnosis. The median time from diagnosis to recurrence was 18.0 months (range 3.6 – 62.6), and site of recurrence was metastatic in 86{\%} (n=12). The median survival after relapse was 6.8 months (range 0.7 – 77.9); 3-year survival after relapse was 19{\%}. There were trend associations between longer survival and having received additional chemotherapy (median survival 6.8 vs. 1.3 months, p = 0.06) and radiation therapy (15.4 vs. 4.4 months, p=0.13), but not research therapy (2.8 vs. 10.3 months, p =0.69.) Conclusions: Recurrence of medulloblastoma is much more likely to be metastatic than reported in previous eras. Within the limits of our small sample, our data suggest a potential survival benefit from re-treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation even in heavily pre-treated patients. This report serves as a baseline against which to evaluate novel therapy combinations.},

abstract = {Integrins are extracellular matrix receptors involved in tumour invasion and angiogenesis. Although there is evidence that inhibiting integrins might enhance the efficiency of radiotherapy, little is known about the exact mechanisms involved in the integrin-dependent modulation of tumor radiosensitivity. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 integrins in glioblastoma cell radioresistance and overall to decipher the downstream biological pathways. We first demonstrated that silencing alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 integrins with specific siRNAs significantly reduced the survival after irradiation of 2 glioblastoma cell lines: U87 and SF763. We then showed that integrin activity and integrin signalling pathways controlled the glioma cell radiosensitivity. This regulation of glioma cell response to ionising radiation was mediated through the integrin-linked kinase, ILK, and the small GTPase, RhoB, by two mechanisms. The first one, independent of ILK, consists in the regulation of the intracellular level of RhoB by alphavbeta3 or alphavbeta5 integrin. The second pathway involved in cell radiosensitivity consists in RhoB activation by ionising radiation through ILK. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the alphavbeta3/alphavbeta5 integrins/ILK/RhoB pathway controlled the glioma cells radiosensitivity by regulating radiation-induced mitotic cell death. This work identifies a new biological pathway controlling glioblastoma cells radioresistance, activated from the membrane through alphavbeta3 and/or alphavbeta5 integrins via ILK and RhoB. Our results are clues that downstream effectors of alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 integrins as ILK and RhoB might also be promising candidate targets for improving the efficiency of radiotherapy and thus the clinical outcome of patients with glioblastoma.},

abstract = {Low survival rates of metastatic cancers emphasize the need for a drug that can prevent and/or treat metastatic cancer. $\alpha$v integrins are involved in essential processes for tumor growth and metastasis and targeting of $\alpha$v integrins has been shown to decrease angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastasis. In this study, the role of $\alpha$v integrin and its potential as a drug target in bladder cancer was investigated. Treatment with an $\alpha$v integrin antagonist as well as knockdown of $\alpha$v integrin in the bladder carcinoma cell lines, resulted in reduced malignancy in vitro, as illustrated by decreased proliferative, migratory and clonogenic capacity. The CDH1/CDH2 ratio increased, indicating a shift towards a more epithelial phenotype. This shift appeared to be associated with downregulation of EMT-inducing transcription factors including SNAI2. The expression levels of the self-renewal genes NANOG and BMI1 decreased as well as the number of cells with high Aldehyde Dehydrogenase activity. In addition, self-renewal ability decreased as measured with the urosphere assay. In line with these observations, knockdown or treatment of $\alpha$v integrins resulted in decreased metastatic growth in preclinical in vivo models as assessed by bioluminescence imaging. In conclusion, we show that $\alpha$v integrins are involved in migration, EMT and maintenance of Aldehyde Dehydrogenase activity in bladder cancer cells. Targeting of $\alpha$v integrins might be a promising approach for treatment and/or prevention of metastatic bladder cancer.},

abstract = {The integrin alpha9beta1 is a multifunctional receptor that interacts with a variety of ligands including vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, tenascin C and osteopontin. We found that this integrin is a receptor for nerve growth factor (NGF) and two other neurotrophins, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and NT3, using a cell adhesion assay with the alpha9SW480 cell line. Interaction of alpha9beta1 with NGF was confirmed in an ELISA assay by direct binding to purified integrin. alpha9beta1 integrin binds to neurotrophins in a manner similar to another common neurotrophin receptor, p75(NTR) (NGFR), although alpha9beta1 activity is correlated with induction of pro-survival and pro-proliferative signaling cascades. This property of alpha9beta1 resembles the interaction of NGF with a high affinity receptor, TrkA, however, this integrin shows a low affinity for NGF. NGF induces chemotaxis of cells expressing alpha9beta1 and their proliferation. Moreover, alpha9beta1 integrin is a signaling receptor for NGF, which activates the MAPK (Erk1/2) pathway. The alpha9beta1-dependent chemotactic ability of NGF appears to result from the activation of paxillin.},

abstract = {Thirty-eight consecutive children treated according to the HIT2000 and HIT91 studies for medulloblastoma who suffered 40 recurrence events were identified from a neuroradiological database. Relapse was associated with younger median age compared with all children treated on HIT2000. Eight patients relapsed with isolated local recurrence. There was no correlation with incomplete surgical removal or violation of the respective treatment protocol. Four patients were younger than 4 years at time of initial presentation and thus were not treated primarily with radiotherapy, suggesting that delayed radiotherapy might be a contributing factor. Meningeal dissemination was present in 32 events; 16 were located in the frontal region, 8 of which were isolated nodular frontal and frontobasal meningeal disease. Circumscribed meningeal recurrences were associated with better overall survival (OS) compared with diffuse, widespread recurrences. Isolated frontobasal meningeal relapses are a well-known phenomenon in medulloblastomas even years after treatment and have been correlated to an underdose of radiation in many literature reports. However, in our patients there was no correlation to possible treatment violations, indicating that inadequate radiation dose to the frontobasal region was unlikely to be a causative factor. Surgical technique varied due to the multicentric nature of our study, so position during surgery was not recognized as a predisposing factor for frontobasal recurrence.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The objective of the current study was to determine the outcome of children with local recurrence or progression of medulloblastoma in patients who received high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) and posterior fossa (PF) irradiation.

METHODS: HDC consisted in busulfan at a dose of 600 mg/m(2) and thiotepa at a dose of 900 mg/m(2) followed by autologous stem cells transplantation (ASCT). PF radiotherapy was delivered at doses from 50 grays (Gy) to 55 Gy on Day +70 after ASCT. Twenty-seven patients developed local recurrence of an initially completely resected medulloblastoma. Twelve patients had local residual disease after surgery and were enrolled into the salvage protocol at the time of local disease progression under conventional chemotherapy.

RESULTS: Acute toxicity consisted mainly in hepatic veno-occlusive disease (33{\%} of patients) and bone marrow aplasia. Two toxic deaths (5{\%}) from infections were reported. The 5-year overall survival rate after this salvage treatment (OS(5y)) for the 39 children who were treated was 68.8{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [95{\%} CI], 53-81.2{\%}). In the group of patients who were treated for local recurrence, the OS(5y) was 77.2{\%} (95{\%} CI, 58.3-89.1{\%}). Patients with local residual disease who were treated at the time of disease progression had an OS(5y) after salvage treatment of only 50{\%} (95{\%} CI, 25.4-74.6{\%}; P = .09).

CONCLUSIONS: The treatment strategy that was used in this study had manageable immediate toxicity and resulted in a high overall survival rate in the setting of young children with medulloblastoma who developed local recurrence or disease progression.},

abstract = {Integrin signaling is comprised of well-characterized pathways generally involved in cell survival. alpha(9)beta(1) integrin has recently become a target of study and has been shown to present pro-survival effects on neutrophils. However, there are no detailed studies on how alpha(9)beta(1) integrin-coupled signaling pathways interact and how they converge to finally modulate spontaneous apoptosis in neutrophils. In this regard we sought to investigate the main signaling events triggered by alpha(9)beta(1) integrin engagement and how these signaling pathways modulate the apoptotic program of human neutrophils. Using VLO5, a snake venom disintegrin shown to bind to alpha(9)beta(1) integrin in neutrophils, we demonstrate that alpha(9)beta(1) integrin engagement leads to the activation of integrin signaling pathways and potently reduces neutrophil spontaneous apoptosis. These effects are dependent on the activation of PI3K and MAPK pathways, since both LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor) or PD95059 (MEK inhibitor) reverted the effects of VLO5/alpha(9)beta(1) interaction. Moreover we show that VLO5/alpha(9)beta(1) engagement induces NF-kappaB nuclear translocation and increases the ratio between anti- and pro-apoptotic proteins by inducing the degradation of pro-apoptotic protein Bad and increasing the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-x(L). VLO5 also inhibited the early steps of neutrophil spontaneous apoptosis by preventing Bax translocation to the outer mitochondrial membrane and consequent cytochrome c release. In conclusion, as the mechanistic details of alpha(9)beta(1) integrin signaling pathways in human neutrophils becomes clearer, it should become possible to develop new therapeutic agents for human diseases where neutrophils play a prominent role.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The treatment of previously irradiated patients with recurrent central nervous system primitive neuroectodermal tumours (PNETs) is a considerable challenge. A study was undertaken to attempt to improve the outcome for such patients using a high dose chemotherapy (HDCT) based strategy.

METHODS: Between 2000 and 2007, 40 patients with relapsed medulloblastoma (MB) and 5 with relapsed supratentorial PNETs (StPNETs) were accrued. All but one had received prior craniospinal radiotherapy. Patients were initially treated with cyclophosphamide (4 g/m(2)) together with surgery or local radiotherapy where appropriate. If complete or near complete remission was achieved, the patient proceeded to receive two sequential courses of HDCT with stem cell rescue. The first course consisted of thiotepa (900 mg/m(2)) and the second carboplatin (AUC 21).

RESULTS: All five patients with StPNET died of tumour progression with a median OS of 0.4 years. Nineteen of the 40 patients with relapsed MB underwent surgery. Radiotherapy was administered to eight patients. All patients received at least one course of cyclophosphamide. Only 22 MB patients progressed to the HDCT phase; 10 patients received thiotepa only and 12 thiotepa and carboplatin. At a median follow-up of 7.4 years (Range 2.8-8.2 years), only three MB patients are still alive, one following a further relapse. Three and 5 year OS was 22.0{\%} and 8.2{\%}, respectively and 3 and 5 year EFS was 14.6{\%} and 8.7{\%}, respectively.

CONCLUSION: This national study based on a strategy including a particular tandem HDCT regimen showed no benefit for previously irradiated patients with relapsed StPNET and very limited benefit for patients with relapsed medulloblastoma.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current treatment for medulloblastoma, which includes postoperative radiotherapy and 1 year of chemotherapy, does not cure many children with high-risk disease. We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of risk-adapted radiotherapy followed by a shortened period of dose-intense chemotherapy in children with medulloblastoma.

METHODS: After resection, patients were classified as having average-risk medulloblastoma ({\textless} or = 1.5 cm2 residual tumour and no metastatic disease) or high-risk medulloblastoma ({\textgreater} 1.5 cm2 residual disease or metastatic disease localised to neuraxis) medulloblastoma. All patients received risk-adapted craniospinal radiotherapy (23.4 Gy for average-risk disease and 36.0-39.6 Gy for high-risk disease) followed by four cycles of cyclophosphamide-based, dose-intensive chemotherapy. Patients were assessed regularly for disease status and treatment side-effects. The primary endpoint was 5-year event-free survival; we also measured overall survival. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00003211.

FINDINGS: Of 134 children with medulloblastoma who underwent treatment (86 average-risk, 48 high-risk), 119 (89{\%}) completed the planned protocol. No treatment-related deaths occurred. 5-year overall survival was 85{\%} (95{\%} CI 75-94) in patients in the average-risk group and 70{\%} (54-84) in those in the high-risk group (p=0.04); 5-year event-free survival was 83{\%} (73-93) and 70{\%} (55-85), respectively (p=0.046). For the 116 patients whose histology was reviewed centrally, histological subtype correlated with 5-year event-free survival (p=0.04): 84{\%} (74-95) for classic histology, 77{\%} (49-100) for desmoplastic tumours, and 57{\%} (33-80) for large-cell anaplastic tumours.

INTERPRETATION: Risk-adapted radiotherapy followed by a shortened schedule of dose-intensive chemotherapy can be used to improve the outcome of patients with high-risk medulloblastoma.},
