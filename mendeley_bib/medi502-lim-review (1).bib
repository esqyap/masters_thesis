abstract = {Medulloblastoma, the most common malignant paediatric brain tumour, is currently treated with nonspecific cytotoxic therapies including surgery, whole-brain radiation, and aggressive chemotherapy. As medulloblastoma exhibits marked intertumoural heterogeneity, with at least four distinct molecular variants, previous attempts to identify targets for therapy have been underpowered because of small samples sizes. Here we report somatic copy number aberrations (SCNAs) in 1,087 unique medulloblastomas. SCNAs are common in medulloblastoma, and are predominantly subgroup-enriched. The most common region of focal copy number gain is a tandem duplication of SNCAIP, a gene associated with Parkinson's disease, which is exquisitely restricted to Group 4$\alpha$. Recurrent translocations of PVT1, including PVT1-MYC and PVT1-NDRG1, that arise through chromothripsis are restricted to Group 3. Numerous targetable SCNAs, including recurrent events targeting TGF-$\beta$ signalling in Group 3, and NF-$\kappa$B signalling in Group 4, suggest future avenues for rational, targeted therapy.},

abstract = {The integrins are a large family of cell adhesion molecules that are essential for the regulation of cell growth and function. The identification of key roles for integrins in a diverse range of diseases, including cancer, infection, thrombosis and autoimmune disorders, has revealed their substantial potential as therapeutic targets. However, so far, pharmacological inhibitors for only three integrins have received marketing approval. This article discusses the structure and function of integrins, their roles in disease and the chequered history of the approved integrin antagonists. Recent advances in the understanding of integrin function, ligand interaction and signalling pathways suggest novel strategies for inhibiting integrin function that could help harness their full potential as therapeutic targets.},

abstract = {Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most frequent malignant brain tumor in children. Patients with MB who are classified as having high-risk disease or those with recurrent disease respond poorly to current therapies and have an increased risk of MB-related mortality. Preclinical studies and molecular profiling of MB tumors have revealed upregulation or activation of several key signaling pathways such as the sonic hedgehog and WNT pathways. Although the exact mechanisms underlying MB tumorigenesis remain poorly understood, inhibiting these key pathways with molecularly targeted therapies represents an important approach to improving MB outcomes. Several molecularly targeted therapies are already under clinical investigation in MB patients. We discuss current preclinical and clinical data, as well as data from clinical trials of targeted therapies that are either ongoing or in development for MB.},

@article{Gajjar2006d,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current treatment for medulloblastoma, which includes postoperative radiotherapy and 1 year of chemotherapy, does not cure many children with high-risk disease. We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of risk-adapted radiotherapy followed by a shortened period of dose-intense chemotherapy in children with medulloblastoma.

METHODS: After resection, patients were classified as having average-risk medulloblastoma ({\textless} or = 1.5 cm2 residual tumour and no metastatic disease) or high-risk medulloblastoma ({\textgreater} 1.5 cm2 residual disease or metastatic disease localised to neuraxis) medulloblastoma. All patients received risk-adapted craniospinal radiotherapy (23.4 Gy for average-risk disease and 36.0-39.6 Gy for high-risk disease) followed by four cycles of cyclophosphamide-based, dose-intensive chemotherapy. Patients were assessed regularly for disease status and treatment side-effects. The primary endpoint was 5-year event-free survival; we also measured overall survival. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00003211.

FINDINGS: Of 134 children with medulloblastoma who underwent treatment (86 average-risk, 48 high-risk), 119 (89{\%}) completed the planned protocol. No treatment-related deaths occurred. 5-year overall survival was 85{\%} (95{\%} CI 75-94) in patients in the average-risk group and 70{\%} (54-84) in those in the high-risk group (p=0.04); 5-year event-free survival was 83{\%} (73-93) and 70{\%} (55-85), respectively (p=0.046). For the 116 patients whose histology was reviewed centrally, histological subtype correlated with 5-year event-free survival (p=0.04): 84{\%} (74-95) for classic histology, 77{\%} (49-100) for desmoplastic tumours, and 57{\%} (33-80) for large-cell anaplastic tumours.

INTERPRETATION: Risk-adapted radiotherapy followed by a shortened schedule of dose-intensive chemotherapy can be used to improve the outcome of patients with high-risk medulloblastoma.},

abstract = {Medulloblastoma is a form of brain cancer that mainly arises during infancy and childhood. Our understanding of this disease has transitioned rapidly; what was once thought of as a single disease entity is now known to be a compendium comprising at least four distinct subtypes of tumour (Wnt, sonic hedgehog [SHH], group 3, and group 4 medulloblastomas) that have characteristic molecular signatures, distinctive clinical features, and are associated with different outcomes. Importantly, medulloblastomas occurring in infants (aged up to 3 years) and adults have unique characteristics, which distinguish the disease from that seen in children aged {\textgreater}3 years. Accordingly, modern treatment approaches in medulloblastoma integrate the molecular and clinical features of the disease to enable provision of the most-effective therapies for each patient, and to reduce long-term sequelae. This Review discusses our current knowledge of medulloblastoma. In particular, we present the genetic and histological features, patient demographics, prognosis, and therapeutic options for each the four molecular tumour subtypes that comprise this disease entity. In addition, the unique features of medulloblastoma in infants and in adults, as compared with childhood and/or adolescent forms, are described.},

abstract = {The emergence of clinical drug resistance continues to be an obstacle for the successful treatment of cancer. Our current understanding of mechanisms associated with drug resistance has been ascertained by investigating drug-resistant models created by exposing a parental population to increasing concentrations of a cytotoxic. These unicellular drug-resistant models have been critical in elucidating drug-resistant mechanism and in some cases have aided in the identification of drug targets. However, these models do not address resistance mechanisms that contribute to de novo drug resistance. We propose that specific niches within the tumor microenvironment may provide a sanctuary for subpopulations of tumors cells that affords a survival advantage following initial drug exposure and may facilitate the acquisition of acquired drug resistance. More specifically, we propose that the bone marrow microenvironment is a sanctuary for hema-topoietic cancers. This review will focus on the bone marrow microenvironment and its role in conferring resistance to cytotoxics and physiological mediators of cell death.},

abstract = {Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane receptors regulating cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions. Of the 24 integrin heterodimers identified in humans, $\alpha$9$\beta$1 integrin is one of the least studied. $\alpha$9, together with $\alpha$4, comprise a more recent evolutionary sub-family of integrins that is only found in vertebrates. Since $\alpha$9 was thought to have similar functions as $\alpha$4, due to many shared ligands, it was a rather overlooked integrin until recently, when its importance for survival after birth was highlighted upon investigation of the $\alpha$9 knockout mouse. $\alpha$9$\beta$1 is expressed on a wide variety of cell types, interacts with many ligands for example fibronectin, tenascin-C and ADAM12, and has been shown to have important functions in processes such as cell adhesion and migration, lung development, lymphatic and venous valve development, and in wound healing. This has sparked an interest to investigate $\alpha$9$\beta$1-mediated signaling and its regulation. This review gives an overview of the recent progress in $\alpha$9$\beta$1-mediated biological and pathological processes, and discusses its potential as a target for cancer diagnosis and therapy.},
