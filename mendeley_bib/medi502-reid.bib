abstract = {Recognized more than a decade ago, NKT cells differentiate from mainstream thymic precursors through instructive signals emanating during TCR engagement by CD1d-expressing cortical thymocytes. Their semi-invariant alphabeta TCRs recognize isoglobotrihexosylceramide, a mammalian glycosphingolipid, as well as microbial alpha-glycuronylceramides found in the cell wall of Gram-negative, lipopolysaccharide-negative bacteria. This dual recognition of self and microbial ligands underlies innate-like antimicrobial functions mediated by CD40L induction and massive Th1 and Th2 cytokine and chemokine release. Through reciprocal activation of NKT cells and dendritic cells, synthetic NKT ligands constitute promising new vaccine adjuvants. NKT cells also regulate a range of immunopathological conditions, but the mechanisms and the ligands involved remain unknown. NKT cell biology has emerged as a new field of research at the frontier between innate and adaptive immunity, providing a powerful model to study fundamental aspects of the cell and structural biology of glycolipid trafficking, processing, and recognition.},

abstract = {Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most frequent malignancy of childhood. Although therapeutical advances have been achieved, some ALL subgroups still fare poorly. CD1d is a monomorphic molecule that provides a suitable target for immunotherapy in view of the characterization of a glycolipid, alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer), capable of being presented to CD1d-restricted T cells with cytotoxic potential. We investigated CD1d expression in 80 pediatric B-cell precursor (BCP) ALL cases defined according to immunophenotype, cytogenetic features and age at onset. CD1d was detected on ALL cells in 15{\%} of the patients. CD1d+ ALLs were significantly associated with infant leukemia, pro-B phenotype and mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL)/AF4 gene rearrangement. Accordingly, overall survival of patients with CD1d+ ALL was significantly shorter. CD1d+ leukemic blasts were able to present alpha-GalCer via CD1d to cytotoxic CD1d-restricted T cells, which induced apoptosis of ALL cells that was inhibited by mAb to CD1d. CD1d+ blasts loaded with alpha-GalCer elicited cytokine secretion by CD1d-restricted T cells. Analysis of bone marrow (BM) cells derived from normal donors revealed that CD19+/CD1d+ cells were mostly mature B lymphocytes. However, a minority of BCPs expressed CD1d. Thus, expression of CD1d in ALL cases heralds an adverse prognosis but may provide a therapeutic tool.},

abstract = {Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common pediatric oncologic diagnosis, and advances in its treatment have led to progressive improvements in survival. The 4 main components of therapy are remission induction, consolidation, maintenance, and central nervous system-directed therapy, and usually last 2 to 3Â years. Treatment intensity based on risk-based stratification is the cornerstone of treatment. Patients with features of more favorable disease are spared the more toxic effects of chemotherapy, whereas more aggressive regimens are reserved for those with higher-risk disease. Prognosis of relapsed pediatric ALL depends primarily on duration of remission and site of relapse.},
