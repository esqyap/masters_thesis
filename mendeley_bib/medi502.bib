abstract = {Arrest of circulating tumor cells in distant organs is required for hematogenous metastasis, but the tumor cell surface molecules responsible have not been identified. Here, we show that the tumor cell alpha3beta1 integrin makes an important contribution to arrest in the lung and to early colony formation. These analyses indicated that pulmonary arrest does not occur merely due to size restriction, and raised the question of how the tumor cell alpha3beta1 integrin contacts its best-defined ligand, laminin (LN)-5, a basement membrane (BM) component. Further analyses revealed that LN-5 is available to the tumor cell in preexisting patches of exposed BM in the pulmonary vasculature. The early arrest of tumor cells in the pulmonary vasculature through interaction of alpha3beta1 integrin with LN-5 in exposed BM provides both a molecular and a structural basis for cell arrest during pulmonary metastasis.},

abstract = {Thirty-eight consecutive children treated according to the HIT2000 and HIT91 studies for medulloblastoma who suffered 40 recurrence events were identified from a neuroradiological database. Relapse was associated with younger median age compared with all children treated on HIT2000. Eight patients relapsed with isolated local recurrence. There was no correlation with incomplete surgical removal or violation of the respective treatment protocol. Four patients were younger than 4 years at time of initial presentation and thus were not treated primarily with radiotherapy, suggesting that delayed radiotherapy might be a contributing factor. Meningeal dissemination was present in 32 events; 16 were located in the frontal region, 8 of which were isolated nodular frontal and frontobasal meningeal disease. Circumscribed meningeal recurrences were associated with better overall survival (OS) compared with diffuse, widespread recurrences. Isolated frontobasal meningeal relapses are a well-known phenomenon in medulloblastomas even years after treatment and have been correlated to an underdose of radiation in many literature reports. However, in our patients there was no correlation to possible treatment violations, indicating that inadequate radiation dose to the frontobasal region was unlikely to be a causative factor. Surgical technique varied due to the multicentric nature of our study, so position during surgery was not recognized as a predisposing factor for frontobasal recurrence.},

abstract = {Integrin signaling is comprised of well-characterized pathways generally involved in cell survival. alpha(9)beta(1) integrin has recently become a target of study and has been shown to present pro-survival effects on neutrophils. However, there are no detailed studies on how alpha(9)beta(1) integrin-coupled signaling pathways interact and how they converge to finally modulate spontaneous apoptosis in neutrophils. In this regard we sought to investigate the main signaling events triggered by alpha(9)beta(1) integrin engagement and how these signaling pathways modulate the apoptotic program of human neutrophils. Using VLO5, a snake venom disintegrin shown to bind to alpha(9)beta(1) integrin in neutrophils, we demonstrate that alpha(9)beta(1) integrin engagement leads to the activation of integrin signaling pathways and potently reduces neutrophil spontaneous apoptosis. These effects are dependent on the activation of PI3K and MAPK pathways, since both LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor) or PD95059 (MEK inhibitor) reverted the effects of VLO5/alpha(9)beta(1) interaction. Moreover we show that VLO5/alpha(9)beta(1) engagement induces NF-kappaB nuclear translocation and increases the ratio between anti- and pro-apoptotic proteins by inducing the degradation of pro-apoptotic protein Bad and increasing the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-x(L). VLO5 also inhibited the early steps of neutrophil spontaneous apoptosis by preventing Bax translocation to the outer mitochondrial membrane and consequent cytochrome c release. In conclusion, as the mechanistic details of alpha(9)beta(1) integrin signaling pathways in human neutrophils becomes clearer, it should become possible to develop new therapeutic agents for human diseases where neutrophils play a prominent role.},

abstract = {Production of type IV collagenase by tumor cells has been linked to their metastatic potential in several experimental models. A possible role for this enzyme in basement membrane type IV collagen turnover has also been suggested. Two recently developed affinity-purified, monospecific antibodies directed against the amino terminus (H1), or an internal active site domain (metal binding region [MBR]) of human type IV collagenase, were employed in the avidin-biotin-immunoperoxidase technique in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded breast tissue samples from 55 patients. Intense cytoplasmic immunostaining of myoepithelial cells was found in normal and hyperplastic tissue, and discontinuous staining was noted in intraductal carcinomas. Luminal epithelial cells were negative or weakly positive in large- or medium-sized ducts but reacted frequently in normal terminal ducts and hyperplastic lesions. Epithelial cells in intraductal carcinomas exhibited immunoreactivity in 20 of 23 cases. Invasive carcinomas were positive in 36 of 40 cases, and metastatic cells in lymph nodes stained in 10 of 12 cases. These results support a role for type IV collagenase in the basement membrane remodeling of normal breast. Our findings suggest that myoepithelial cells play a pivotal role in this enzymatic activity. The high percentage of positive cells in invasive carcinomas and the strong immunoreactivity of lymph node metastases support the role of the enzyme in tumor invasion and metastasis and suggest that tumor cells are the essential source of the enzyme in these processes.},

@article{Ridola2007b,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The objective of the current study was to determine the outcome of children with local recurrence or progression of medulloblastoma in patients who received high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) and posterior fossa (PF) irradiation.

METHODS: HDC consisted in busulfan at a dose of 600 mg/m(2) and thiotepa at a dose of 900 mg/m(2) followed by autologous stem cells transplantation (ASCT). PF radiotherapy was delivered at doses from 50 grays (Gy) to 55 Gy on Day +70 after ASCT. Twenty-seven patients developed local recurrence of an initially completely resected medulloblastoma. Twelve patients had local residual disease after surgery and were enrolled into the salvage protocol at the time of local disease progression under conventional chemotherapy.

RESULTS: Acute toxicity consisted mainly in hepatic veno-occlusive disease (33{\%} of patients) and bone marrow aplasia. Two toxic deaths (5{\%}) from infections were reported. The 5-year overall survival rate after this salvage treatment (OS(5y)) for the 39 children who were treated was 68.8{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [95{\%} CI], 53-81.2{\%}). In the group of patients who were treated for local recurrence, the OS(5y) was 77.2{\%} (95{\%} CI, 58.3-89.1{\%}). Patients with local residual disease who were treated at the time of disease progression had an OS(5y) after salvage treatment of only 50{\%} (95{\%} CI, 25.4-74.6{\%}; P = .09).

CONCLUSIONS: The treatment strategy that was used in this study had manageable immediate toxicity and resulted in a high overall survival rate in the setting of young children with medulloblastoma who developed local recurrence or disease progression.},

abstract = {Medulloblastoma, the most common malignant paediatric brain tumour, is currently treated with nonspecific cytotoxic therapies including surgery, whole-brain radiation, and aggressive chemotherapy. As medulloblastoma exhibits marked intertumoural heterogeneity, with at least four distinct molecular variants, previous attempts to identify targets for therapy have been underpowered because of small samples sizes. Here we report somatic copy number aberrations (SCNAs) in 1,087 unique medulloblastomas. SCNAs are common in medulloblastoma, and are predominantly subgroup-enriched. The most common region of focal copy number gain is a tandem duplication of SNCAIP, a gene associated with Parkinson's disease, which is exquisitely restricted to Group 4$\alpha$. Recurrent translocations of PVT1, including PVT1-MYC and PVT1-NDRG1, that arise through chromothripsis are restricted to Group 3. Numerous targetable SCNAs, including recurrent events targeting TGF-$\beta$ signalling in Group 3, and NF-$\kappa$B signalling in Group 4, suggest future avenues for rational, targeted therapy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The treatment of previously irradiated patients with recurrent central nervous system primitive neuroectodermal tumours (PNETs) is a considerable challenge. A study was undertaken to attempt to improve the outcome for such patients using a high dose chemotherapy (HDCT) based strategy.

METHODS: Between 2000 and 2007, 40 patients with relapsed medulloblastoma (MB) and 5 with relapsed supratentorial PNETs (StPNETs) were accrued. All but one had received prior craniospinal radiotherapy. Patients were initially treated with cyclophosphamide (4 g/m(2)) together with surgery or local radiotherapy where appropriate. If complete or near complete remission was achieved, the patient proceeded to receive two sequential courses of HDCT with stem cell rescue. The first course consisted of thiotepa (900 mg/m(2)) and the second carboplatin (AUC 21).

RESULTS: All five patients with StPNET died of tumour progression with a median OS of 0.4 years. Nineteen of the 40 patients with relapsed MB underwent surgery. Radiotherapy was administered to eight patients. All patients received at least one course of cyclophosphamide. Only 22 MB patients progressed to the HDCT phase; 10 patients received thiotepa only and 12 thiotepa and carboplatin. At a median follow-up of 7.4 years (Range 2.8-8.2 years), only three MB patients are still alive, one following a further relapse. Three and 5 year OS was 22.0{\%} and 8.2{\%}, respectively and 3 and 5 year EFS was 14.6{\%} and 8.7{\%}, respectively.

CONCLUSION: This national study based on a strategy including a particular tandem HDCT regimen showed no benefit for previously irradiated patients with relapsed StPNET and very limited benefit for patients with relapsed medulloblastoma.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The alpha6beta4 integrin, a laminin receptor, has been implicated from many studies in tumor progression and invasion. We showed that the beta4 integrin subunit associates with the ErbB-2 tyrosine kinase in human mammary carcinoma cell lines and that its overexpression in NIH3T3/ErbB-2-transformed cells causes a constitutive activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), inducing a strong increase of their invasive capacity. In this study, we investigated the biological consequences of interference with the endogenous beta4 integrin subunit expression. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In vitro and in vivo tumor growth and the biochemical consequences of beta4 integrin inactivation were studied in mammary tumor cells by using short hairpin RNA approach. RESULTS: Our data show that tumor growth of mammary tumor cells strictly depends on beta4 expression, confirming the relevance of beta4 protein in these cells. Moreover, interference with beta4 expression significantly reduces endogenous PI3K activity and AKT and mammalian target of rapamycin phosphorylation. Accordingly, with these results and considering that PI3K activity in mammary tumor plays a relevant role in hormone resistance, we asked whether beta4 expression might be relevant for hormone responsiveness in these cells. Data reported indicate that the interference with endogenous beta4 expression, upon hormone deprivation, induces caspase-9 and cytochrome c-mediated apoptosis, which is enhanced upon tamoxifen treatment. On the other hand, the expression of myr-AKT in MCF7 beta4-short hairpin RNA cells rescues the cells from apoptosis in the absence of hormones and upon tamoxifen treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results confirm the relevance of beta4 expression in mammary tumors and indicate this integrin as a relevant target for tumor therapy.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant paediatric brain tumour. Recurrence and progression of disease occurs in 15-20{\%} of standard risk and 30-40{\%} of high risk patients. We analysed whether circumvention of chemoresistance pathways (drug export, DNA repair and apoptotic inhibition) can restore chemotherapeutic efficacy in a panel of MB cell lines.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We demonstrate, by immunohistochemistry in patient tissue microarrays, that ABCB1 is expressed in 43{\%} of tumours and is significantly associated with high-risk. We show that ABCB1, O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) and BCL2 family members are differentially expressed (by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting and flow cytometry) in MB cell lines. Based on these findings, each pathway was then inhibited or circumvented and cell survival assessed using clonogenic assays. Inhibition of ABCB1 using vardenafil or verapamil resulted in a significant increase in sensitivity to etoposide in ABCB1-expressing MB cell lines. Sensitivity to temozolomide (TMZ) was MGMT-dependent, but two novel imidazotetrazine derivatives (N-3 sulfoxide and N-3 propargyl TMZ analogues) demonstrated {\textgreater}=7 fold and {\textgreater}=3 fold more potent cytotoxicity respectively compared to TMZ in MGMT-expressing MB cell lines. Activity of the BAD mimetic ABT-737 was BCL2A1 and ABCB1 dependent, whereas the pan-BCL2 inhibitor obatoclax was effective as a single cytotoxic agent irrespective of MCL1, BCL2, BCL2A1, or ABCB1 expression.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: ABCB1 is associated with high-risk MB; hence, inhibition of ABCB1 by vardenafil may represent a valid approach in these patients. Imidazotetrazine analogues of TMZ and the BH3 mimetic obatoclax are promising clinical candidates in drug resistant MB tumours expressing MGMT and BCL2 anti-apoptotic members respectively.},

This allows the cancer cell to pull itself forward into the tissue. The attachment is mediated by cell-surface receptors known as integrins, which bind to components of the extracellular matrix. Integrins are crucial for cell invasion and migration, not only for physically tethering cells to the matrix, but also for sending and receiving molecular signals that regulate these processes.},

abstract = {Medulloblastomas are the most common malignant brain tumors in childhood. Emerging evidence suggests that medulloblastoma comprises at least four distinct diseases (WNT, SHH, Group 3 and 4) with different biology, clinical presentation, and outcome, with especially poor prognosis in Group 3. The tight connection of biology and clinical behavior in patients emphasizes the need for subgroup-specific preclinical models in order to develop treatments tailored to each subgroup. Herein we report on the novel cell line HD-MB03, isolated from tumor material of a patient with metastasized Group 3 medulloblastoma, and preclinical testing of different histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) in this model. HD-MB03 cells grow long term in vitro and form metastatic tumors in vivo upon orthotopic transplantation. HD-MB03 cells reflect the original Group 3 medulloblastoma at the histological and molecular level, showing large cell morphology, similar expression patterns for markers Ki67, p53, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a gene expression profile most closely matching Group 3 medulloblastomas, and persistence of typical molecular alterations, i.e., isochromosome 17q [i(17q)] and MYC amplification. Protein expression analysis of HDACs 2, 5, 8, and 9 as well as the predictive marker HR23B showed intermediate to strong expression, suggesting sensitivity to HDACis. Indeed, treatment with HDACis Helminthosporium carbonum (HC)-toxin, vorinostat, and panobinostat revealed high sensitivity to this novel drug class, as well as a radiation-sensitizing effect with significantly increased cell death upon concomitant treatment. In summary, our data indicate that HD-MB03 is a suitable preclinical model for Group 3 medulloblastoma, and HDACis could represent a therapeutic option for this subgroup.},

abstract = {Cancer cells as well as bacteria metastasize to the subarachnoidal space (SAS) causing meningitis. Primary brain tumors, although not forming distant metastases, disseminate via the cerebrospinal fluid and occupy the meninges. The multistep process of cancer or bacterial dissemination is regulated through molecular crosstalk between invaders and host cells. Such crosstalks establish invasion-promoter and invasion-suppressor complexes. In carcinomatous and bacterial meningitis, the participation of host cells is prominent since leukocytes and inflammatory cytokines are the major determinants of malignancy. We propose a model in which bacterial breakdown products activate endothelial cells, a process leading to leukocyte extravasation. This initiates a cascade of inflammatory processes opening up the blood cerebrospinal fluid barrier and producing access for new invaders.},

However, most patients ultimately develop resistance to these drugs. Here, we report a novel mechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors and the reversal of which could improve clinical outcomes. In erlotinib-resistant lung cancer cells harboring activating EGFR mutations that we established, there was increased expression of Src, integrin $\beta$1, $\alpha$2, and $\alpha$5 along with enhanced cell adhesion activity. Interestingly, RNAi-mediated silencing of integrin $\beta$1 restored erlotinib sensitivity and reduced activation of Src and Akt after erlotinib treatment. Furthermore, Src silencing inhibited Akt phosphorylation and cell growth, with this inhibitory effect further augmented by erlotinib treatment. Increased expression of integrin $\beta$1, $\alpha$5, and/or $\alpha$2 was also observed in refractory tumor samples from patients with lung cancer treated with erlotinib and/or gefitinib. Together, our findings identify the integrin $\beta$1/Src/Akt signaling pathway as a key mediator of acquired resistance to EGFR-targeted anticancer drugs.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine the event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival of children with average-risk medulloblastoma and treated with reduced-dose craniospinal radiotherapy (CSRT) and one of two postradiotherapy chemotherapies. METHODS: Four hundred twenty-one patients between 3 years and 21 years of age with nondisseminated medulloblastoma (MB) were prospectively randomly assigned to treatment with 23.4 Gy of CSRT, 55.8 Gy of posterior fossa RT, plus one of two adjuvant chemotherapy regimens: lomustine (CCNU), cisplatin, and vincristine; or cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, and vincristine. Results Forty-two of 421 patients enrolled were excluded from analysis. Sixty-six of the remaining 379 patients had incompletely assessable postoperative studies. Five-year EFS and survival for the cohort of 379 patients was 81{\%} +/- 2.1{\%} and 86{\%} +/- 9{\%}, respectively (median follow-up over 5 years). EFS was unaffected by sex, race, age, treatment regimen, brainstem involvement, or excessive anaplasia. EFS was detrimentally affected by neuroradiographic unassessability. Patients with areas of frank dissemination had a 5-year EFS of 36{\%} +/- 15{\%}. Sixty-seven percent of progressions had some component of dissemination. There were seven second malignancies. Infections occurred more frequently on the cyclophosphamide arm and electrolyte abnormalities were more common on the CCNU regimen. CONCLUSION: This study discloses an encouraging EFS rate for children with nondisseminated MB treated with reduced-dose craniospinal radiation and chemotherapy. Additional, careful, step-wise reductions in CSRT in adequately staged patients may be possible.},

abstract = {Chemotherapeutic drug resistance in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a significant problem, resulting in poor responsiveness to first-line treatment or relapse after transient remission. Classical anti-leukemic drugs are non-specific cell cycle poisons; some more modern drugs target oncogenic pathways in leukemia cells, although in ALL these do not play a very significant role. By contrast, the molecular interactions between microenvironment and leukemia cells are often neglected in the design of novel therapies against drug resistant leukemia. It was shown however, that chemotherapy resistance is promoted in part through cell-cell contact of leukemia cells with bone marrow (BM) stromal cells, also called cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR). Incomplete response to chemotherapy results in persistence of resistant clones with or without detectable minimal residual disease (MRD). Approaches for how to address CAM-DR and MRD remain elusive. Specifically, studies using anti-functional antibodies and genetic models have identified integrin alpha4 as a critical molecule regulating BM homing and active retention of normal and leukemic cells. Pre-clinical evidence has been provided that interference with alpha4-mediated adhesion of ALL cells can sensitize them to chemotherapy and thus facilitate eradication of ALL cells in an MRD setting. To this end, Andreeff and colleagues recently provided evidence of stroma-induced and alpha4-mediated nuclear factor-$\kappa$B signaling in leukemia cells, disruption of which depletes leukemia cells of strong survival signals. We here review the available evidence supporting the targeting of alpha4 as a novel strategy for treatment of drug resistant leukemia.},

This compound, a cyclic RGD-penta-peptide, is a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis, which induces apoptosis of growing endothelial cells through inhibition of their alpha v-integrin interaction with the matrix proteins vitronectin and tenascin. Here we show that EMD 121974 also induces apoptosis in the alpha v-integrin-expressing tumor cell lines U87 MG and DAOY by detaching them from vitronectin and tenascin, matrix proteins known to be essential for brain tumor growth and invasion. These matrix proteins are shown to be produced by the brain tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, only tumor cells expressing alpha v-integrins responded to the treatment with EMD 121974, after xenotransplantation into the forebrain of nude mice, supporting the importance of tumor cell-matrix interactions in tumor cell survival in the brain. Thus, the alpha v-antagonist EMD 121974 suppresses brain tumor growth through induction of apoptosis in both brain capillary and brain tumor cells by preventing their interaction with the matrix proteins vitronectin and tenascin. The dual action of this peptide explains its potent growth suppression of orthotopically transplanted brain tumors.},

Here, we show that adhesion of Jurkat T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells to substrates engaging $\alpha$4$\beta$1-integrin or $\alpha$5$\beta$1-integrin promotes chemoresistance to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. Reconstituted expression of $\alpha$4$\delta$, a truncated $\alpha$4-integrin with KXGFFKR as the cytoplasmic motif, in $\alpha$4-deficient cells promoted chemoresistance to doxorubicin in a manner independent of $\alpha$4-mediated adhesion. The adhesion-independent chemoresistance did not require $\beta$1-integrin as the heterodimeric pair, since expression of Tac$\delta$, a monomeric nonintegrin transmembrane protein fused to the juxtamembrane KXGFFKR, was sufficient to reproduce the phenomenon. The requirement for integrin-mediated adhesion in stimulation of Akt phosphorylation and activation was bypassed for cells expressing $\alpha$4$\delta$ and Tac$\delta$. Cells expressing $\alpha$4$\delta$ and Tac$\delta$ exhibited a high influx of extracellular Ca(2+), and inhibition of Ca(2+) channels with verapamil attenuated the adhesion-independent chemoresistance. Tac$\delta$ cells also exhibited greater rates of drug efflux. $\alpha$4$\delta$ and Tac$\delta$ interacted with the Ca(2+)-binding protein calreticulin, in a manner dependent on the KXGFFKR motif. Adhesion-mediated engagement of $\alpha$4-integrins promoted an increased calreticulin-$\alpha$4 association and greater influx of extracellular Ca(2+) than in nonadherent cells. The $\alpha$-integrin KXGFFKR motif is involved in adhesion-mediated control of chemoresistance in T cells.},

In this study, the role of $\alpha$v integrin and its potential as a drug target in bladder cancer was investigated. Treatment with an $\alpha$v integrin antagonist as well as knockdown of $\alpha$v integrin in the bladder carcinoma cell lines, resulted in reduced malignancy in vitro, as illustrated by decreased proliferative, migratory and clonogenic capacity. The CDH1/CDH2 ratio increased, indicating a shift towards a more epithelial phenotype. This shift appeared to be associated with downregulation of EMT-inducing transcription factors including SNAI2. The expression levels of the self-renewal genes NANOG and BMI1 decreased as well as the number of cells with high Aldehyde Dehydrogenase activity. In addition, self-renewal ability decreased as measured with the urosphere assay. In line with these observations, knockdown or treatment of $\alpha$v integrins resulted in decreased metastatic growth in preclinical in vivo models as assessed by bioluminescence imaging. In conclusion, we show that $\alpha$v integrins are involved in migration, EMT and maintenance of Aldehyde Dehydrogenase activity in bladder cancer cells.

abstract = {Medulloblastoma is the most frequent malignant brain tumor in children and is considered to be of neuroectodermal origin. Two main representative cell lines, DAOY and D283, are widely used in studies of medulloblastoma. The former shows expression of neuronal and glial elements whereas the latter is assigned to neuronal lineages. We decided to systematically study the proteome of these cell lines in order to find novel and known proteins that could serve as candidate markers or could be of interest as specific antigens for future vaccines. We studied DAOY and D283 by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis with subsequent matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization identification. A series of identified medulloblastoma proteins were already described in many other malignancies of different origin. An antiapoptotic principle, Ded protein, was observed in both cell lines. Several hypothetical proteins, that were never described at the protein level but only predicted from nucleic acid sequences, could be identified. We conclude that medulloblastoma proteins SYT interacting protein, similar to glucose related protein 58 kDa, hypothetical 37.5 kDa protein, serologically defined colon cancer antigen 10, hepatocellular carcinoma-associated antigen 59, X-ray repair complementing defective repair in CHO 5, hypothetical protein Q96ir7, nit protein 2 and hypothetical protein Q96e67, have been described in a series of other malignancies possibly indicating a role for those in tumor biology and pathomechanisms. The antiapoptotic principle, Ded protein, found in both cell lineages may stand for immortalization but could also determine malignancy per se in medulloblastoma.},

abstract = {Medulloblastomas (MB) are the most common malignant brain tumors in childhood. Alkylator-based drugs are effective agents in the treatment of patients with MB. In several tumors, including malignant glioma, elevated O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression levels or lack of MGMT promoter methylation have been found to be associated with resistance to alkylating chemotherapeutic agents such as temozolomide (TMZ). In this study, we examined the MGMT status of MB and central nervous system primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) cells and two large sets of primary MB. In seven MB/PNET cell lines investigated, MGMT promoter methylation was detected only in D425 human MB cells as assayed by the qualitative methylation-specific PCR and the more quantitative pyrosequencing assay. In D425 human MB cells, MGMT mRNA and protein expression was clearly lower when compared with the MGMT expression in the other MB/PNET cell lines. In MB/PNET cells, sensitivity towards TMZ and 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea (CCNU) correlated with MGMT methylation and MGMT mRNA expression. Pyrosequencing in 67 primary MB samples revealed a mean percentage of MGMT methylation of 3.7-92{\%} (mean: 13.25{\%}, median: 10.67{\%}). Percentage of MGMT methylation and MGMT mRNA expression as determined by quantitative RT-PCR correlated inversely (n = 46; Pearson correlation r (2) = 0.14, P = 0.01). We then analyzed MGMT mRNA expression in a second set of 47 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded primary MB samples from clinically well-documented patients treated within the prospective randomized multicenter trial HIT'91. No association was found between MGMT mRNA expression and progression-free or overall survival. Therefore, it is not currently recommended to use MGMT mRNA expression analysis to determine who should receive alkylating agents and who should not.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor of childhood. Children who relapse usually die of their disease, which reflects resistance to radiation and/or chemotherapy. Improvements in outcome require a better understanding of the molecular basis of medulloblastoma growth and treatment response. TP73 is a member of the TP53 tumor suppressor gene family that has been found to be overexpressed in a variety of tumors and mediates apoptotic responses to genotoxic stress. In this study, we assessed expression of TP73 RNA species in patient tumor specimens and in medulloblastoma cell lines, and manipulated expression of full-length TAp73 and amino-terminal truncated DeltaNp73 to assess their effects on growth. METHODS: We analyzed medulloblastoma samples from thirty-four pediatric patients and the established medulloblastoma cell lines, Daoy and D283MED, for expression of TP73 RNA including the full-length transcript and the 5'-terminal variants that encode the DeltaNp73 isoform, as well as TP53 RNA using quantitative real time-RTPCR. Protein expression of TAp73 and DeltaNp73 was quantitated with immunoblotting methods. Clinical outcome was analyzed based on TP73 RNA and p53 protein expression. To determine effects of overexpression or knock-down of TAp73 and DeltaNp73 on cell cycle and apoptosis, we analyzed transiently transfected medulloblastoma cell lines with flow cytometric and TUNEL methods. RESULTS: Patient medulloblastoma samples and cell lines expressed full-length and 5'-terminal variant TP73 RNA species in 100-fold excess compared to non-neoplastic brain controls. Western immunoblot analysis confirmed their elevated levels of TAp73 and amino-terminal truncated DeltaNp73 proteins. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed trends toward favorable overall and progression-free survival of patients whose tumors display TAp73 RNA overexpression. Overexpression of TAp73 or DeltaNp73 induced apoptosis under basal growth conditions in vitro and sensitized them to cell death in response to chemotherapeutic agents. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that primary medulloblastomas express significant levels of TP73 isoforms, and suggest that they can modulate the survival and genotoxic responsiveness of medulloblastomas cells.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: A phase I trial of the antiangiogenesis agent cilengitide (EMD 121974), an alpha v beta 3,5 integrin antagonist, was performed to estimate the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and describe dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and the incidence and severity of other toxicities when administered to children with refractory brain tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-one assessable patients received intravenous cilengitide over 1 hour twice a week for up to 52 weeks at dosages from 120 to 2,400 mg/m(2). Serial blood and urine samples for clinical pharmacology studies were obtained in a subset of consenting patients. RESULTS: No DLTs were observed, and thus, the MTD was not estimated. Three of 13 patients at the dosage level of 2,400 mg/m(2) experienced grade 3 or 4 intratumoral hemorrhage (ITH) possibly related to the study drug; however, two of the ITH events were asymptomatic and, by the current toxicity criteria, would be classified as grade 1. For patients treated at cilengitide 2,400 mg/m(2), the 6-month cumulative incidence estimate of ITH is 23{\%} (SE = 13{\%}). No ITH was observed at 1,800 mg/m(2). Three patients completed 1 year of protocol therapy; one patient with glioblastoma multiforme demonstrated complete response, and two patients had stable disease (SD). An additional patient had SD for more than 5 months. CONCLUSION: The phase II dosage of intravenous cilengitide in children with refractory brain tumors is 1,800 mg/m(2). A phase II trial to assess the efficacy of cilengitide therapy for children with refractory brain tumors is being developed by the Children's Oncology Group.},

abstract = {The constitutive activation of $\beta$-catenin signaling in the mammary basal epithelial cell layer in transgenic K5$\Delta$N$\beta$cat mice leads to basal-type tumor development. Integrins of the $\beta$1 family and integrin-mediated signaling events have an important role in breast tumor growth and progression. We show here that the deletion of $\alpha$3$\beta$1 integrin, a major laminin receptor, from the basal layer of the mammary epithelium of K5$\Delta$N$\beta$cat mice completely prevented the tumorigenesis induced by $\beta$-catenin signaling. Moreover, the depletion of $\alpha$3$\beta$1 integrin from a spontaneously transformed mouse mammary basal epithelial cell line (MEC) prevented the cells from forming colonies in soft agar and greatly reduced tumor development in orthotopic grafts. Inhibition of the integrin signaling intermediates Rac1 or PAK1 (P21-activated Kinase 1) in MEC affected tumor cell growth in soft agar, whereas the expression of activated forms of these effectors in $\alpha$3-depleted cells rescued the capacity of these cells to grow in non-adherent conditions. Similarly, the tumorigenic potential of $\alpha$3-depleted cells was restored by the expression of activated PAK1, as assessed by orthotopic transplantation assay. In three-dimensional Matrigel culture, MEC survival and proliferation were affected by the depletion of $\alpha$3$\beta$1 integrin, which also significantly decreased the activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK). Our data suggest that the activation of signaling cascades downstream from $\alpha$3$\beta$1 and involving the Rac1/PAK1 pathway, MAPK and JNK, promotes prosurvival and proproliferative signals required for the malignant growth of basal mammary epithelial cells, providing further insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying breast cancer initiation and progression.},

abstract = {Recognized more than a decade ago, NKT cells differentiate from mainstream thymic precursors through instructive signals emanating during TCR engagement by CD1d-expressing cortical thymocytes. Their semi-invariant alphabeta TCRs recognize isoglobotrihexosylceramide, a mammalian glycosphingolipid, as well as microbial alpha-glycuronylceramides found in the cell wall of Gram-negative, lipopolysaccharide-negative bacteria. This dual recognition of self and microbial ligands underlies innate-like antimicrobial functions mediated by CD40L induction and massive Th1 and Th2 cytokine and chemokine release. Through reciprocal activation of NKT cells and dendritic cells, synthetic NKT ligands constitute promising new vaccine adjuvants. NKT cells also regulate a range of immunopathological conditions, but the mechanisms and the ligands involved remain unknown. NKT cell biology has emerged as a new field of research at the frontier between innate and adaptive immunity, providing a powerful model to study fundamental aspects of the cell and structural biology of glycolipid trafficking, processing, and recognition.},

abstract = {Anoikis (or cell-detachment-induced apoptosis) is a self-defense strategy that organisms use to eliminate ‘misplaced' cells, i.e. cells that are in an inappropriate location. Occasionally, detached or misplaced cells can overcome anoikis and survive for a certain period of time in the absence of the correct signals from the extracellular matrix (ECM). If cells are able to adapt to their new environment, then they have probably become anchorage-independent, which is one of the hallmarks of cancer cells. Anoikis resistance and anchorage-independency allow tumor cells to expand and invade adjacent tissues, and to disseminate through the body, giving rise to metastasis. Thus, overcoming anoikis is a crucial step in a series of changes that a tumor cell undergoes during malignant transformation. Tumor cells have developed a variety of strategies to bypass or overcome anoikis. Some strategies consist of adaptive cellular changes that allow the cells to behave as they would in the correct environment, so that induction of anoikis is aborted. Other strategies aim to counteract the negative effects of anoikis induction by hyperactivating survival and proliferative cascades. The recently discovered processes of autophagy and entosis also highlight the contribution of these mechanisms to rendering the cells in a dormant state until they receive a signal initiated at the ECM, thereby circumventing anoikis. In all situations, the final outcome is the ability of the tumor to grow and metastasize. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying anoikis resistance could help to counteract tumor progression and prevent metastasis formation.},

abstract = {BackgroundCilengitide, an v integrin antagonist, has demonstrated activity in recurrent adult glioblastoma (GBM). The Children's Oncology Group ACNS0621 study thus evaluated whether cilengitide is active as a single agent in the treatment of children with refractory high-grade glioma (HGG). Secondary objectives were to investigate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics of cilengitide in this population.MethodsCilengitide (1800 mg/m2/dose intravenous) was administered twice weekly until evidence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Thirty patients (age range, 1.1-20.3 years) were enrolled, of whom 24 were evaluable for the primary response end point.ResultsToxicity was infrequent and mild, with the exception of one episode of grade 2 pain possibly related to cilengitide. Two intratumoral hemorrhages were reported, but only one (grade 2) was deemed to be possibly related to cilengitide and was in the context of disease progression. One patient with GBM received cilengitide for 20 months and remains alive with continuous stable disease. There were no other responders, with median time to tumor progression of 28 days (range, 11-114 days). Twenty-one of the 24 evaluable patients died, with a median time from enrollment to death of 172 days (range, 28-325 days). The 3 patients alive at the time of this report had a follow-up time of 37, 223, and 1068 days, respectively.ConclusionsWe conclude that cilengitide is not effective as a single agent for refractory pediatric HGG. However, further study evaluating combination therapy with cilengitide is warranted before a role for cilengitide in the treatment of pediatric HGG can be excluded. {\textcopyright} 2013 {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2013.

abstract = {Some cancers like melanoma and pancreatic and ovarian cancers, for example, commonly display resistance to chemotherapy, and this is the major obstacle to a better prognosis of patients. Frequently, literature presents studies in monolayer cell cultures, 3D cell cultures or in vivo studies, but rarely the same work compares results of drug resistance in different models. Several of these works are presented in this review and show that usually cells in 3D culture are more resistant to drugs than monolayer cultured cells due to different mechanisms. Searching for new strategies to sensitize different tumors to chemotherapy, many methods have been studied to understand the mechanisms whereby cancer cells acquire drug resistance. These methods have been strongly advanced along the years and therapies using different drugs have been increasingly proposed to induce cell death in resistant cells of different cancers. Recently, cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been extensively studied because they would be the only cells capable of sustaining tumorigenesis. It is believed that the resistance of CSCs to currently used chemotherapeutics is a major contributing factor in cancer recurrence and later metastasis development. This review aims to appraise the experimental progress in the study of acquired drug resistance of cancer cells in different models as well as to understand the role of CSCs as the major contributing factor in cancer recurrence and metastasis development, describing how CSCs can be identified and isolated.},

abstract = {Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most frequent malignant brain tumor in children. Patients with MB who are classified as having high-risk disease or those with recurrent disease respond poorly to current therapies and have an increased risk of MB-related mortality. Preclinical studies and molecular profiling of MB tumors have revealed upregulation or activation of several key signaling pathways such as the sonic hedgehog and WNT pathways. Although the exact mechanisms underlying MB tumorigenesis remain poorly understood, inhibiting these key pathways with molecularly targeted therapies represents an important approach to improving MB outcomes. Several molecularly targeted therapies are already under clinical investigation in MB patients. We discuss current preclinical and clinical data, as well as data from clinical trials of targeted therapies that are either ongoing or in development for MB.},

abstract = {During progression from tumour growth to metastasis, specific integrin signals enable cancer cells to detach from neighbouring cells, re-orientate their polarity during migration, and survive and proliferate in foreign microenvironments. There is increasing evidence that certain integrins associate with receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) to activate signalling pathways that are necessary for tumour invasion and metastasis. The effect of these integrins might be especially important in cancer cells that have activating mutations, or amplifications, of the genes that encode these RTKs.},

Cancer therapeutics that are designed to target adhesion receptors or proteases have not proven to be effective in slowing tumour progression in clinical trials--this might be due to the fact that cancer cells can modify their migration mechanisms in response to different conditions. Learning more about the cellular and molecular basis of these different migration/invasion programmes will help us to understand how cancer cells disseminate and lead to new treatment strategies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current treatment for medulloblastoma, which includes postoperative radiotherapy and 1 year of chemotherapy, does not cure many children with high-risk disease. We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of risk-adapted radiotherapy followed by a shortened period of dose-intense chemotherapy in children with medulloblastoma.

METHODS: After resection, patients were classified as having average-risk medulloblastoma ({\textless} or = 1.5 cm2 residual tumour and no metastatic disease) or high-risk medulloblastoma ({\textgreater} 1.5 cm2 residual disease or metastatic disease localised to neuraxis) medulloblastoma. All patients received risk-adapted craniospinal radiotherapy (23.4 Gy for average-risk disease and 36.0-39.6 Gy for high-risk disease) followed by four cycles of cyclophosphamide-based, dose-intensive chemotherapy. Patients were assessed regularly for disease status and treatment side-effects. The primary endpoint was 5-year event-free survival; we also measured overall survival. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00003211.

FINDINGS: Of 134 children with medulloblastoma who underwent treatment (86 average-risk, 48 high-risk), 119 (89{\%}) completed the planned protocol. No treatment-related deaths occurred. 5-year overall survival was 85{\%} (95{\%} CI 75-94) in patients in the average-risk group and 70{\%} (54-84) in those in the high-risk group (p=0.04); 5-year event-free survival was 83{\%} (73-93) and 70{\%} (55-85), respectively (p=0.046). For the 116 patients whose histology was reviewed centrally, histological subtype correlated with 5-year event-free survival (p=0.04): 84{\%} (74-95) for classic histology, 77{\%} (49-100) for desmoplastic tumours, and 57{\%} (33-80) for large-cell anaplastic tumours.

INTERPRETATION: Risk-adapted radiotherapy followed by a shortened schedule of dose-intensive chemotherapy can be used to improve the outcome of patients with high-risk medulloblastoma.},

abstract = {A pharmacologic approach to male contraception remains a longstanding challenge in medicine. Toward this objective, we explored the spermatogenic effects of a selective small-molecule inhibitor (JQ1) of the bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) subfamily of epigenetic reader proteins. Here, we report potent inhibition of the testis-specific member BRDT, which is essential for chromatin remodeling during spermatogenesis. Biochemical and crystallographic studies confirm that occupancy of the BRDT acetyl-lysine binding pocket by JQ1 prevents recognition of acetylated histone H4. Treatment of mice with JQ1 reduced seminiferous tubule area, testis size, and spermatozoa number and motility without affecting hormone levels. Although JQ1-treated males mate normally, inhibitory effects of JQ1 evident at the spermatocyte and round spermatid stages cause a complete and reversible contraceptive effect. These data establish a new contraceptive that can cross the blood:testis boundary and inhibit bromodomain activity during spermatogenesis, providing a lead compound targeting the male germ cell for contraception.

abstract = {Medulloblastoma is a form of brain cancer that mainly arises during infancy and childhood. Our understanding of this disease has transitioned rapidly; what was once thought of as a single disease entity is now known to be a compendium comprising at least four distinct subtypes of tumour (Wnt, sonic hedgehog [SHH], group 3, and group 4 medulloblastomas) that have characteristic molecular signatures, distinctive clinical features, and are associated with different outcomes. Importantly, medulloblastomas occurring in infants (aged up to 3 years) and adults have unique characteristics, which distinguish the disease from that seen in children aged {\textgreater}3 years. Accordingly, modern treatment approaches in medulloblastoma integrate the molecular and clinical features of the disease to enable provision of the most-effective therapies for each patient, and to reduce long-term sequelae. This Review discusses our current knowledge of medulloblastoma. In particular, we present the genetic and histological features, patient demographics, prognosis, and therapeutic options for each the four molecular tumour subtypes that comprise this disease entity. In addition, the unique features of medulloblastoma in infants and in adults, as compared with childhood and/or adolescent forms, are described.},

abstract = {Vitronectin (VN) is an extracellular matrix (ECM) protein, the synthesis of which in vivo by glioma cells correlates with tumor grade. Although the role of VN as a permissive substrate for glioma migration has been well characterized, its role in conferring a survival advantage for tumor cells has not been addressed previously. By using an in vitro assay of DNA fragmentation as a quantitative measure of apoptotic cell death, we sought to determine whether the sensitivity of two human glioma cell lines (D54 and U251) to drug-induced apoptosis could be inhibited by VN. As well, the extent to which apoptosis could be inhibited was correlated with the levels of the Bcl-2 family of proteins that are known to modulate apoptosis and chemoresistance. Results of the study were: (a) VN coatings, in a dose-dependent manner, inhibited topoisomerase (Topo)-induced apoptosis by up to 50{\%} (optimal coating density, 500 ng/cm2); in contrast, fibronectin (FN), an ECM protein present in abundance in the brain, demonstrated no protection; (b) in a dose-response study, VN clearly conferred a survival advantage (LD50 of Topo: on VN, 120 ng/ml; on FN, 35 ng/ml); (c) the protective effect of VN was not due to enhanced cell adhesion or alterations in the cell cycle distribution; (d) both of the classic integrin receptors that bind VN (alpha(v)beta3, alpha(v)beta5) were capable of mediating this protective effect, because ligation of either of the two classic integrins conferred chemoresistance to Topo; and (e) chemoresistance observed with VN was associated with an increase in expression of two antiapoptotic proteins, Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L), with a consequent increase in the ratios for Bcl-2:Bax and Bcl-X(L):Bax. VN, an ECM protein preferentially expressed at the tumor-brain interface in vivo, may confer a survival advantage to glioma cells at the advancing tumor margin and may thus, in part, underlie the high level of tumor recurrence at this interface.},

CD1d is a monomorphic molecule that provides a suitable target for immunotherapy in view of the characterization of a glycolipid, alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer), capable of being presented to CD1d-restricted T cells with cytotoxic potential. We investigated CD1d expression in 80 pediatric B-cell precursor (BCP) ALL cases defined according to immunophenotype, cytogenetic features and age at onset. CD1d was detected on ALL cells in 15{\%} of the patients. CD1d+ ALLs were significantly associated with infant leukemia, pro-B phenotype and mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL)/AF4 gene rearrangement. Accordingly, overall survival of patients with CD1d+ ALL was significantly shorter. CD1d+ leukemic blasts were able to present alpha-GalCer via CD1d to cytotoxic CD1d-restricted T cells, which induced apoptosis of ALL cells that was inhibited by mAb to CD1d. CD1d+ blasts loaded with alpha-GalCer elicited cytokine secretion by CD1d-restricted T cells. Analysis of bone marrow (BM) cells derived from normal donors revealed that CD19+/CD1d+ cells were mostly mature B lymphocytes. However, a minority of BCPs expressed CD1d. Thus, expression of CD1d in ALL cases heralds an adverse prognosis but may provide a therapeutic tool.},

Here, we show that $\alpha$v$\beta$3 plays a critical role in adultmammary stem cells (MaSCs) during pregnancy. Whereas $\alpha$v$\beta$3 is a luminal progenitor marker in thevirgin gland, we noted increased $\alpha$v$\beta$3 expression in MaSCs at midpregnancy. Accordingly, mice lacking $\alpha$v$\beta$3 or expressing a signaling-deficient receptor showed defective mammary gland morphogenesisduring pregnancy. This was associated with decreased MaSC expansion, clonogenicity, and expression of Slug, a master regulator of MaSCs. Surprisingly, $\alpha$v$\beta$3-deficient mice displayed normal development of the virgin gland with no effect on luminal progenitors. Transforming growth factor $\beta$2 (TGF-$\beta$2) induced $\alpha$v$\beta$3 expression, enhancing Slug nuclear accumulation and MaSC clonogenicity. In human breast cancer cells, $\alpha$v$\beta$3 was necessary and sufficient for Slug activation, tumorsphere formation, and tumor initiation. Thus, pregnancy-associated MaSCs require a TGF-$\beta$2/$\alpha$v$\beta$3/Slug pathway, which may contribute to breast cancer progression and stemness. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

Bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) bromodomain inhibition has recently been shown to suppress MYC-associated transcriptional activity in other cancers. The compound JQ1 inhibits BET bromodomain-containing proteins, including BRD4. Here, we investigate BET bromodomain targeting for the treatment of MYC-amplified medulloblastoma.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We evaluated the effects of genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of BET bromodomains on proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis in established and newly generated patient- and genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM)-derived medulloblastoma cell lines and xenografts that harbored amplifications of MYC or MYCN. We also assessed the effect of JQ1 on MYC expression and global MYC-associated transcriptional activity. We assessed the in vivo efficacy of JQ1 in orthotopic xenografts established in immunocompromised mice.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Treatment of MYC-amplified medulloblastoma cells with JQ1 decreased cell viability associated with arrest at G1 and apoptosis. We observed downregulation of MYC expression and confirmed the inhibition of MYC-associated transcriptional targets. The exogenous expression of MYC from a retroviral promoter reduced the effect of JQ1 on cell viability, suggesting that attenuated levels of MYC contribute to the functional effects of JQ1. JQ1 significantly prolonged the survival of orthotopic xenograft models of MYC-amplified medulloblastoma (P {\textless} 0.001). Xenografts harvested from mice after five doses of JQ1 had reduced the expression of MYC mRNA and a reduced proliferative index.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: JQ1 suppresses MYC expression and MYC-associated transcriptional activity in medulloblastomas, resulting in an overall decrease in medulloblastoma cell viability. These preclinical findings highlight the promise of BET bromodomain inhibitors as novel agents for MYC-amplified medulloblastoma.},

We found that this integrin is a receptor for nerve growth factor (NGF) and two other neurotrophins, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and NT3, using a cell adhesion assay with the alpha9SW480 cell line. Interaction of alpha9beta1 with NGF was confirmed in an ELISA assay by direct binding to purified integrin. alpha9beta1 integrin binds to neurotrophins in a manner similar to another common neurotrophin receptor, p75(NTR) (NGFR), although alpha9beta1 activity is correlated with induction of pro-survival and pro-proliferative signaling cascades. This property of alpha9beta1 resembles the interaction of NGF with a high affinity receptor, TrkA, however, this integrin shows a low affinity for NGF. NGF induces chemotaxis of cells expressing alpha9beta1 and their proliferation. Moreover, alpha9beta1 integrin is a signaling receptor for NGF, which activates the MAPK (Erk1/2) pathway. The alpha9beta1-dependent chemotactic ability of NGF appears to result from the activation of paxillin.},

Methods: With approval of the Institutional Review Board, medical records were reviewed for 55 patients diagnosed with medulloblastoma between 2000 and 2010, and treated at Seattle Children's Hospital, the largest pediatric cancer center in the Pacific Northwest, with referrals from Washington, Alaska, Montana, Idaho and Wyoming. Forty-seven children over the age of three at initial diagnosis were considered for this analysis. The following variables were collected for patients diagnosed with recurrent or progressive disease: age at diagnosis, gender, stage, histology, time to relapse, site of relapse, treatment after relapse, and time to death or last contact. Survival was described according to the method of Kaplan and Meier and comparisons were made using the log rank test. Results: Fourteen of 47 patients (30{\%}) experienced recurrent or progressive medulloblastoma. The median age at diagnosis was 9 years (range 5.8 to 15.9), and 71{\%} (n=10) were male. Most patients had localized disease (M0, 78.6{\%}), classic histology (78.6{\%}) and gross total resection (92.9{\%}) at initial diagnosis. The median time from diagnosis to recurrence was 18.0 months (range 3.6 – 62.6), and site of recurrence was metastatic in 86{\%} (n=12). The median survival after relapse was 6.8 months (range 0.7 – 77.9); 3-year survival after relapse was 19{\%}. There were trend associations between longer survival and having received additional chemotherapy (median survival 6.8 vs. 1.3 months, p = 0.06) and radiation therapy (15.4 vs. 4.4 months, p=0.13), but not research therapy (2.8 vs. 10.3 months, p =0.69.) Conclusions: Recurrence of medulloblastoma is much more likely to be metastatic than reported in previous eras. Within the limits of our small sample, our data suggest a potential survival benefit from re-treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation even in heavily pre-treated patients. This report serves as a baseline against which to evaluate novel therapy combinations.},

abstract = {Local recurrence continues to limit survival in medulloblastoma patients, largely related to the persistence of invasive cells at the site of tumour resection and leptomeningeal dissemination. Given the relative dearth of understanding of causative mechanisms behind the invasiveness of medulloblastomas, and a general lack of validated in vitro models with which to study them, our objectives were (1) to obtain quantitative data on the invasiveness of five distinct medulloblastoma cell lines within a 3-dimensional in vitro collagen-based model; and (2) to characterize some of the mechanisms behind invasion, specifically striving to identify proteolytic processes that occur as medulloblastoma cells disrupt and thereby invade the normal tissue surrounding them, and specific inhibitors of these proteolytic enzymes. Five different medulloblastoma cell lines (UW228-1, 2 and 3; Daoy, and Madsen) were implanted onto a 3-dimensional, type I collagen gel assay to assess tumour invasion distance and mean doubling time over 5 days. Proteolytic activity was assessed against collagen types I and IV by measuring the degradation of 3H-collagen I and IV to products soluble in 100{\%} w/v trichloroacetic acid; and general (neutral) proteolytic activity evaluated by measuring the degradation of 3H-albumin. In other experiments, cells were pre-exposed to a variety of protease inhibitors, including inhibitors of metalloproteinases and cysteine, serine and aspartic proteases, and then plated to identify any inhibition of invasion. Inter-group differences in mean invasion distance were assessed by means of Student's t-tests for non-paired subjects, with P {\textless} 0.05 set as the threshold for statistical significance. For the inhibitor studies, an inhibition index, called the inhibitory concentration 50, IC-50, was calculated by performing a regression analysis for each inhibitor tested over a range of concentrations, for each cell line. Within hours of implantation, individual cells readily detached from the surface of the cell aggregates and invaded the collagen matrix, to distances of up to 1,200 mum and at rates of up to 300-mum per day; the UW228-1 cell line clearly was less invasive than the other four cell lines. Proteolytic activity was identified against collagen type I, but not against collagen type IV or albumin; but there was no apparent correlation between invasion distance and either cell doubling time or the amount of collagen type I proteolytic activity. Both metalloproteinase inhibitors suppressed tumour invasion, as did one of two cysteine protease inhibitors; but there was no tumour suppression with either serine or aspartic protease inhibition. MMP-1 and 2, and TIMP-1 and 2 all were detectable by Western blot analysis. Medulloblastoma cell invasiveness within the 3-dimensional model used here appears to depend upon a combination of metalloproteinase and cysteine protease activity, a finding that may suggest areas for potential future clinical investigation and therapy.},

It can be mainly divided into classical and desmoplastic tumours, but differential diagnosis is often difficult. Patients' prognosis is poor and neuropathological markers that reliably predict outcome are still missing. In a series of 104 MBs including 80 tumours of the classical and 24 tumours of the desmoplastic variant we studied the number of apoptotic figures and the expression of the proto-oncogene bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic protein known to affect tumour cell proliferation. We observed a strong correlation between the expression of bcl-2 with patients' age (P {\textless} 0.001) as well as with the desmoplastic subtype (P {\textless} 0.001). Here, protein expression was found to be restricted to internodular, less differentiated, highly proliferative areas. In classical MB, bcl-2 was detected only in 23{\%} of cases and was highly inversely correlated with the expression of synaptophysin (P {\textless} 0.001) indicating that bcl-2 is predominantly expressed by undifferentiated classical MB. With regard to prognosis the expression of bcl-2 tended to correlate with poor outcome in classical MB but not in desmoplastic MB, although not to a statistically significant extension (P = 0.06). On the other hand, a high number of apoptotic figures in the tumour tissue was found to indicate poor prognosis independent of the histological subtype (P {\textless} 0.05).},

abstract = {The development of a drug-resistant cell line can take from 3 to 18 months. However, little is published on the methodology of this development process. This article will discuss key decisions to be made prior to starting resistant cell line development; the choice of parent cell line, dose of selecting agent, treatment interval, and optimizing the dose of drug for the parent cell line. Clinically relevant drug-resistant cell lines are developed by mimicking the conditions cancer patients experience during chemotherapy and cell lines display between two- and eight-fold resistance compared to their parental cell line. Doses of drug administered are low, and a pulsed treatment strategy is often used where the cells recover in drug-free media. High-level laboratory models are developed with the aim of understanding potential mechanisms of resistance to chemotherapy agents. Doses of drug are higher and escalated over time. It is common to have difficulty developing stable clinically relevant drug-resistant cell lines. A comparative selection strategy of multiple cell lines or multiple chemotherapeutic agents mitigates this risk and gives insight into which agents or type of cell line develops resistance easily. Successful selection strategies from our research are presented. Pulsed-selection produced platinum or taxane-resistant large cell lung cancer (H1299 and H460) and temozolomide-resistant melanoma (Malme-3M and HT144) cell lines. Continuous selection produced a lapatinib-resistant breast cancer cell line (HCC1954). Techniques for maintaining drug-resistant cell lines are outlined including; maintaining cells with chemotherapy, pulse treating with chemotherapy, or returning to master drug-resistant stocks. The heterogeneity of drug-resistant models produced from the same parent cell line with the same chemotherapy agent is explored with reference to P-glycoprotein. Heterogeneity in drug-resistant cell lines reflects the heterogeneity that can occur in clinical drug resistance.},

Our current understanding of mechanisms associated with drug resistance has been ascertained by investigating drug-resistant models created by exposing a parental population to increasing concentrations of a cytotoxic. These unicellular drug-resistant models have been critical in elucidating drug-resistant mechanism and in some cases have aided in the identification of drug targets. However, these models do not address resistance mechanisms that contribute to de novo drug resistance. We propose that specific niches within the tumor microenvironment may provide a sanctuary for subpopulations of tumors cells that affords a survival advantage following initial drug exposure and may facilitate the acquisition of acquired drug resistance. More specifically, we propose that the bone marrow microenvironment is a sanctuary for hema-topoietic cancers. This review will focus on the bone marrow microenvironment and its role in conferring resistance to cytotoxics and physiological mediators of cell death.},

abstract = {CDX2 is a Drosophila caudal-related homeobox transcription factor that is important for the establishment and maintenance of intestinal epithelial cells. CDX2 is a marker of colon cancer, with strong staining in up to 90{\%} of colonic adenocarcinomas. CDX2 heterozygous-null mice develop colonic neoplasms, which have suggested that CDX2 is a tumor suppressor. However, CDX2 has not been reported to affect xenograft growth. Furthermore, CDX2 is rarely mutated in colon cancer, which has led to suggestions that it may play only a minor role as a tumor suppressor in colon cancer. To understand the functional contributions of CDX2 to colon cancer, we disrupted CDX2 in LOVO and SW48 human colon cancer cell lines by targeted homologous recombination. Consistent with the literature, disruption of CDX2 enhanced anchorage-dependent cell proliferation. However, homozygous loss of CDX2 led to significant inhibition of anchorage-independent growth in LOVO cells, and cell lethality in SW48 cells. Further analyses revealed that disruption of CDX2 led to anchorage-independent G1 to S growth arrest and anoikis. In vivo xenograft studies confirmed that disruption of CDX2 inhibited LOVO tumor growth. These data demonstrate that CDX2 mediates anchorage-independent growth and survival. Thus, CDX2 has tumorigenic potential in the human colon cancer cell lines LOVO and SW48.},

Of the 24 integrin heterodimers identified in humans, $\alpha$9$\beta$1 integrin is one of the least studied. $\alpha$9, together with $\alpha$4, comprise a more recent evolutionary sub-family of integrins that is only found in vertebrates. Since $\alpha$9 was thought to have similar functions as $\alpha$4, due to many shared ligands, it was a rather overlooked integrin until recently, when its importance for survival after birth was highlighted upon investigation of the $\alpha$9 knockout mouse. $\alpha$9$\beta$1 is expressed on a wide variety of cell types, interacts with many ligands for example fibronectin, tenascin-C and ADAM12, and has been shown to have important functions in processes such as cell adhesion and migration, lung development, lymphatic and venous valve development, and in wound healing. This has sparked an interest to investigate $\alpha$9$\beta$1-mediated signaling and its regulation. This review gives an overview of the recent progress in $\alpha$9$\beta$1-mediated biological and pathological processes, and discusses its potential as a target for cancer diagnosis and therapy.},

abstract = {Integrins play a role in the resistance of advanced cancers to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. In this study, we show that high expression of the $\alpha$5 integrin subunit compromises temozolomide-induced tumor suppressor p53 activity in human glioblastoma cells. We found that depletion of the $\alpha$5 integrin subunit increased p53 activity and temozolomide sensitivity. However, when cells were treated with the p53 activator nutlin-3a, the protective effect of $\alpha$5 integrin on p53 activation and cell survival was lost. In a functional p53 background, nutlin-3a downregulated the $\alpha$5 integrin subunit, thereby increasing the cytotoxic effect of temozolomide. Clinically, $\alpha$5$\beta$1 integrin expression was associated with a more aggressive phenotype in brain tumors, and high $\alpha$5 integrin gene expression was associated with decreased survival of patients with high-grade glioma. Taken together, our findings indicate that negative cross-talk between $\alpha$5$\beta$1 integrin and p53 supports glioma resistance to temozolomide, providing preclinical proof-of-concept that $\alpha$5$\beta$1 integrin represents a therapeutic target for high-grade brain tumors. Direct activation of p53 may remain a therapeutic option in the subset of patients with high-grade gliomas that express both functional p53 and a high level of $\alpha$5$\beta$1 integrin.},

abstract = {Although primary treatment of medulloblastoma is now successful in a high percentage of patients, its secondary manifestations still bear a poor prognosis. Thorough studies of secondary manifestations are therefore pivotal to plan therapeutic approaches for the long-term management of medulloblastoma. Here we describe the incidence of secondary tumour manifestations in 66 patients of a single centre who underwent surgery for medulloblastoma between 1975 and 1990. No patient was excluded due to a poor postoperative course. Thirty-five patients showed evidence of secondary tumour growth. Of these, 17 suffered from local recurrence, and 27 developed metastastatic disease. The median latencies for secondary manifestations were 25 months for local recurrence (n = 17), 11 months for spinal metastases (n = 10), 15 months for supratentorial metastases (n = 8), 8 months for subleptomeningeal dissemination (n = 6), and 23 months for systemic metastases (n = 8). Two patients developed primary metastatic spread to the posterior fossa. Of 8 patients with supratentorial metastases, 6 developed fronto-basal lesions. In our patients, 89{\%} of secondary lesions occurred within less than 3 years after primary diagnosis. 85{\%} of patients with extra-axial tumour spread had been treated with a permanent shunt. Radical tumour resection and radiotherapy with 30 Gy to the neuraxis and 20 Gy boost to the posterior fossa was an important prognostic factor in this series. Patients with additional chemotherapy did not benefit significantly from this treatment. We conclude that optimal management of the primary lesions should aim at (i) total resection, (ii) avoid permanent shunting, and (iii) completion of the radiotherapy with inclusion of the medial frontobasal cisterns in the radiotherapeutic regimen. Our analysis suggests that adequate postoperative screening programmes should consist of 3-monthly scans of the neuraxis in the first three postoperative years and 6-monthly scans thereafter.},

Since this type of apoptosis has been referred to as anoikis, we designated these cells as anoikis-positive. However, a minor proportion of Caco-2 cells, designated as anoikis-negative, survived in suspension. Extended incubation of the cells in suspension resulted in the reduction of the number of viable cells. In comparison to the original Caco-2 cell population, the anoikis-negative cells demonstrated markedly decreased levels of expression of integrin alphavbeta3 on the cell surface and of transcription of the alphav subunit gene. Activation of the signaling function of alphavbeta3 in the original Caco-2 cells led to substantial stimulation of anoikis, while the inhibition of expression of this receptor resulted in better resistance of the cells to anoikis. The data provide the first evidence that alphavbeta3 integrin can generate apoptosis-stimulating signals.},

abstract = {Integrins are extracellular matrix receptors involved in tumour invasion and angiogenesis. Although there is evidence that inhibiting integrins might enhance the efficiency of radiotherapy, little is known about the exact mechanisms involved in the integrin-dependent modulation of tumor radiosensitivity. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 integrins in glioblastoma cell radioresistance and overall to decipher the downstream biological pathways. We first demonstrated that silencing alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 integrins with specific siRNAs significantly reduced the survival after irradiation of 2 glioblastoma cell lines: U87 and SF763. We then showed that integrin activity and integrin signalling pathways controlled the glioma cell radiosensitivity. This regulation of glioma cell response to ionising radiation was mediated through the integrin-linked kinase, ILK, and the small GTPase, RhoB, by two mechanisms. The first one, independent of ILK, consists in the regulation of the intracellular level of RhoB by alphavbeta3 or alphavbeta5 integrin. The second pathway involved in cell radiosensitivity consists in RhoB activation by ionising radiation through ILK. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the alphavbeta3/alphavbeta5 integrins/ILK/RhoB pathway controlled the glioma cells radiosensitivity by regulating radiation-induced mitotic cell death. This work identifies a new biological pathway controlling glioblastoma cells radioresistance, activated from the membrane through alphavbeta3 and/or alphavbeta5 integrins via ILK and RhoB. Our results are clues that downstream effectors of alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 integrins as ILK and RhoB might also be promising candidate targets for improving the efficiency of radiotherapy and thus the clinical outcome of patients with glioblastoma.},

Glioblastoma are known to be highly resistant to chemotherapy. We, therefore, investigated whether blocking alpha5beta1 integrin with specific nonpeptidic antagonists concomitantly with chemotherapy (ellipticine and temozolomide) may impact the response to chemotherapy of human glioblastoma. Here we show that inhibiting alpha5beta1 integrin with 2 selective ligands (SJ749 and K34c) decreases chemotherapy-induced premature senescence and facilitates cell apoptosis in a functional p53 background (U87MG cells). When p53 is mutated and inactive (U373 cells), chemotherapy induces p53-independent cell apoptosis instead of senescence that is not improved by integrin antagonists. Silencing p53 in U87MG cells with siRNA as well as evaluating HCT116 p53+/+ and p53-/- colon carcinoma cell behavior support the hypothesis of an as yet unknown effect of alpha5beta1 integrin antagonists on the control of chemotherapy-induced premature senescence and apoptosis. alpha5beta1 integrin antagonists modulate the p53 signaling induced by chemotherapy. Our results highlight a new role of the alpha5beta1 integrin in the control of glioblastoma aggressiveness and responsiveness to chemotherapy, which may have a crucial impact in the clinical management of patients suffering from brain tumors.},

abstract = {Anoikis is defined as apoptosis that is induced by inadequate or inappropriate cell-matrix interactions. It is involved in a wide diversity of tissue-homeostatic, developmental and oncogenic processes. The central problem of anoikis is to understand how integrin-mediated cell adhesion signals control the apoptotic machinery. In particular, the initiation of the caspase cascade in anoikis remains to be explained.},

abstract = {Anoikis is a programmed cell death induced upon cell detachment from extracellular matrix, behaving as a critical mechanism in preventing adherent-independent cell growth and attachment to an inappropriate matrix, thus avoiding colonizing of distant organs. As anchorage-independent growth and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, two features associated with anoikis resistance, are vital steps during cancer progression and metastatic colonization, the ability of cancer cells to resist anoikis has now attracted main attention from the scientific community. Cancer cells develop anoikis resistance due to several mechanisms, including change in integrins' repertoire allowing them to grow in different niches, activation of a plethora of inside-out pro-survival signals as over-activation of receptors due to sustained autocrine loops, oncogene activation, growth factor receptor overexpression, or mutation/upregulation of key enzymes involved in integrin or growth factor receptor signaling. In addition, tumor microenvironment has also been acknowledged to contribute to anoikis resistance of bystander cancer cells, by modulating matrix stiffness, enhancing oxidative stress, producing pro-survival soluble factors, triggering epithelial-mesenchymal transition and self-renewal ability, as well as leading to metabolic deregulations of cancer cells. All these events help cancer cells to inhibit the apoptosis machinery and sustain pro-survival signals after detachment, counteracting anoikis and constituting promising targets for anti-metastatic pharmacological therapy.

abstract = {Acquired drug resistance continues to be one of the major obstacles hindering the successful treatment of many forms of cancer. Compounds utilized as antagonists of these cytoprotective mechanisms have, for the most part, proven to be ineffective at overcoming clinical resistance to cytotoxic drugs. Recently, the tumor cell microenvironment has been found to have a significant bearing on the survival of tumor cells following exposure to a wide variety of anti-neoplastic agents, prior to the acquisition of known drug resistance mechanisms. Specifically, interactions between cell surface integrins and extracellular matrix components have been shown to be responsible for this phenomenon of innate drug resistance, which we have termed Cell Adhesion Mediated Drug Resistance, or CAM-DR. Following its discovery using a multiple myeloma cell line model, evidence for CAM-DR has been found in a multitude of other human tumor cell types. In contrast to many other drug resistance mechanisms, integrin-mediated cell signaling is capable of protecting against death induced by an extremely wide variety of structurally and functionally diverse agents from traditional DNA damaging agents to the promising novel kinase inhibitor STI-571. This review examines the role of integrins in regard to their ability to protect tumor cells from drug- and radiation-induced apoptosis through numerous intracellular mechanisms. Current and future antagonists of specific integrin heterodimers may have the potential to sensitize tumor cells when used in combination with standard chemotherapy regimens. Specific signal transduction pathways initiated by integrin ligation will also be discussed as potential bridge points for inhibiting cell survival during cytotoxic drug exposure.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: With current treatment strategies, nearly half of all medulloblastoma (MB) patients die from progressive tumors. Accordingly, the identification of novel therapeutic strategies remains a major goal. Deregulation of c-MYC is evident in numerous human cancers. In MB, over-expression of c-MYC has been shown to cause anaplasia and correlate with unfavorable prognosis. METHODS: To study the role of c-MYC in MB biology, we down-regulated c-MYC expression by using small interfering RNA (siRNA) and investigated changes in cellular proliferation, cell cycle analysis, apoptosis, telomere maintenance, and response to ionizing radiation (IR) and chemotherapeutics in a representative panel of human MB cell lines expressing different levels of c-MYC (DAOY wild-type, DAOY transfected with the empty vector, DAOY transfected with c-MYC, D341, and D425). RESULTS: siRNA-mediated c-MYC down-regulation resulted in an inhibition of cellular proliferation and clonogenic growth, inhibition of G1-S phase cell cycle progression, and a decrease in human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) expression and telomerase activity. On the other hand, down-regulation of c-MYC reduced apoptosis and decreased the sensitivity of human MB cells to IR, cisplatin, and etoposide. This effect was more pronounced in DAOY cells expressing high levels of c-MYC when compared with DAOY wild-type or DAOY cells transfected with the empty vector. CONCLUSION: In human MB cells, in addition to its roles in growth and proliferation, c-MYC is also a potent inducer of apoptosis. Therefore, targeting c-MYC might be of therapeutic benefit when used sequentially with chemo- and radiotherapy rather than concomitantly.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Medulloblastoma (MB) is an aggressive pediatric tumor of the Central Nervous System (CNS) usually treated according to a refined risk stratification. The study of cancer stem cells (CSC) in MB is a promising approach aimed at finding new treatment strategies.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The CSC compartment was studied in three characterized MB cell lines (DAOY, UW228 and ONS-76) grown in standard adhesion as well as being grown as spheres, which enables expansion of the CSC population. MB cell lines, grown in adherence and as spheres, were subjected to morphologic analysis at the light and electron microscopic level, as well as cytofluorimetric determinations. Medullospheres (MBS) were shown to express increasingly immature features, along with the stem cells markers: CD133, Nestin and $\beta$-catenin. Proteomic analysis highlighted the differences between MB cell lines, demonstrating a unique protein profile for each cell line, and minor differences when grown as spheres. In MBS, MALDI-TOF also identified some proteins, that have been linked to tumor progression and resistance, such as Nucleophosmin (NPM). In addition, immunocytochemistry detected Sox-2 as a stemness marker of MBS, as well as confirming high NPM expression.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Culture conditioning based on low attachment flasks and specialized medium may provide new data on the staminal compartment of CNS tumors, although a proteomic profile of CSC is still elusive for MB.},
