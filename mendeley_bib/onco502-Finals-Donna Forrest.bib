abstract = {B cells may be implicated in the pathophysiology of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), as evidenced by antibody production against sex-mismatched, Y chromosome-encoded minor HLA antigens in association with chronic GVHD. We therefore designed a phase 1/2 study of anti-B-cell therapy with rituximab in steroid-refractory chronic GVHD. Twenty-one patients were treated with 38 cycles of rituximab. Rituximab was tolerated well, and toxicity was limited to infectious events. The clinical response rate was 70{\%}, including 2 patients with complete responses. Responses were limited to patients with cutaneous and musculoskeletal manifestations of chronic GVHD and were durable through 1 year after therapy. The median dose of prednisone among treated subjects fell from 40 mg/day to 10 mg/day, 1 year after rituximab therapy (P {\textless} .001). A chronic GVHD symptom score improved in the majority of treated patients. Antibody titers against Y chromosome-encoded minor HLA antigens fell and remained low, whereas titers against infectious antigens (EBV, tetanus) remained stable or rose during the treatment period. We conclude that specific anti-B-cell therapy with rituximab may be beneficial for patients with steroidrefractory chronic GVHD. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as {\#}NCT00136396.},

@article{Ball2008b,
abstract = {Allogeneic hematopoietic SCT (HSCT) is an established treatment for some children with life-threatening hematological disease, immune deficiencies and inborn errors of metabolism. Despite advances in prevention and post transplant immuno-suppressive strategies, acute GvHD (aGvHD) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children undergoing SCT. Although reported incidence rates differ, it has been estimated that, depending upon the patient and donor cohort studied, 20-50{\%} of all transplanted patients will experience grade 2 or more aGvHD despite immuno-suppressive prophylaxis. aGvHD occurs when transplanted donor T lymphocytes recognize antigenic disparities between the host and recipient. Pathways other than direct T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity have been shown to be important in the pathogenesis. Inflammatory cytokine release has been implicated as the primary mediator of aGvHD and activation of T cells is one step in the complex process. Deregulated cytokine release by cells other than T cells leads to tissue damage associated with aGvHD. GvHD is a factor that compromises the overall success rate of allogeneic HSCT and remains a challenge, which, in turn, requires an understanding of the pathophysiology, clinical presentation and management of this complication. The authors concentrate on the most recent knowledge of the pathogenesis as well as the classification of aGvHD.},

@article{Zhang2006b,
abstract = {Chronic graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality of long-term survivors of allogeneic hemato-poietic cell transplantation (HCT). Chronic GVHD can have features of an autoimmune collagen vascular disease with clinical manifestations similar to autoimmune scleroderma and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, the pathogenesis of chronic GVHD is poorly understood. It is unclear how autoreactive T and B cells are generated in chronic GVHD recipients. We have recently developed a new chronic GVHD model by transplantation of donor DBA/2 (H-2d) spleen cells into major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-matched but minor antigen-mismatched sublethally irradiated BALB/c (H-2d) recipients as well as athymic BALB/c(nu/nu) and adult-thymectomized BALB/c recipients. Both euthymic and athymic BALB/c recipients developed high levels of serum IgG autoantibodies, sclerodermatous skin damage, and glomerulonephritis. Disease induction required both donor CD25-CD4+ T and B cells in transplants. In contrast, donor CD25+CD4+ T regulatory (Treg) cells prevented the disease induction. These results indicate that host thymus is not required for induction of chronic GVHD and that quiescent autoreactive T and B cells in transplants from nonautoimmune donors may be activated and expanded to cause chronic GVHD with autoimmune manifestations in allogeneic recipients, and donor Treg cells can suppress this process.},

@article{Takahashi2007b,
abstract = {We studied the clinical outcomes of 171 adults with hematologic malignancies who received unrelated cord blood transplantation (CBT) as a primary unrelated stem-cell source (n=100), or bone marrow transplant (BMT) or peripheral blood stem-cell transplant (PBSCT) from related donors (n=71, 55 BMT and 16 PBSCT). All patients received myeloablative regimens including 12 Gy total body irradiation. We analyzed the hematologic recovery, and risks of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), transplantation-related mortality (TRM) and relapse, and disease-free survival (DFS) using Cox proportional hazards models. Significant delays in engraftment occurred after cord blood transplantation; however, overall engraftment rates were almost the same for both grafts. The cumulative incidences of grades III to IV acute and extensive-type chronic GVHDs among CBT recipients were significantly lower than those among BMT/PBSCT recipients. Multivariate analysis demonstrated no apparent differences in TRM (9{\%} in CBT and 13{\%} in BMT/PBSCT recipients), relapse (17{\%} in CBT and 26{\%} in BMT/PBSCT recipients), and DFS (70{\%} in CBT and 60{\%} in BMT/PBSCT recipients) between both groups. These data suggest that unrelated cord blood could be as safe and effective a stem-cell source as related bone marrow or mobilized peripheral blood for adult patients when it is used as a primary unrelated stem-cell source.},

@article{Sarantopoulos2007b,
abstract = {PURPOSE: Recent studies suggest that donor B cells as well as T cells contribute to immune pathology in patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). B-cell activating factor (BAFF) promotes survival and differentiation of activated B cells. Thus, we tested whether BAFF correlated with chronic GVHD disease activity and time of onset after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients who had undergone allogeneic HSCT between 1994 and 2005 for hematologic malignancies were studied. ELISA was used to measure plasma BAFF levels and flow cytometry was used to assess BAFF receptor expression on B cells in patients with or without chronic GVHD.

RESULTS: In 104 patients, BAFF levels were significantly higher in patients with active chronic GVHD compared with those without disease (P = 0.02 and 0.0004, respectively). Treatment with high-dose prednisone ({\textgreater}or=30 mg/d) was associated with reduced BAFF levels in patients with active chronic GVHD (P = 0.0005). Serial studies in 24 patients showed that BAFF levels were high in the first 3 months after HSCT but subsequently decreased in 13 patients who never developed chronic GVHD. In contrast, BAFF levels remained elevated in 11 patients who developed chronic GVHD. Six-month BAFF levels {\textgreater}or=10 ng/mL were strongly associated with subsequent development of chronic GVHD (P {\textless} 0.0001). Following transplant, plasma BAFF levels correlated inversely with BAFF receptor expression on B cells (P = 0.01), suggesting that soluble BAFF affected B cells through this receptor.

CONCLUSION: These results suggest that elevated BAFF levels contribute to B-cell activation in patients with active chronic GVHD.},
