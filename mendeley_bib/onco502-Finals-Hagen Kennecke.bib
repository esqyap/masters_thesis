abstract = {PURPOSE: Prior reports have indicated that patients with colon cancer who demonstrate high-level microsatellite instability (MSI-H) or defective DNA mismatch repair (dMMR) have improved survival and receive no benefit from fluorouracil (FU) -based adjuvant therapy compared with patients who have microsatellite-stable or proficient mismatch repair (pMMR) tumors. We examined MMR status as a predictor of adjuvant therapy benefit in patients with stages II and III colon cancer.

METHODS: MSI assay or immunohistochemistry for MMR proteins were performed on 457 patients who were previously randomly assigned to FU-based therapy (either FU + levamisole or FU + leucovorin; n = 229) versus no postsurgical treatment (n = 228). Data were subsequently pooled with data from a previous analysis. The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS).

RESULTS: Overall, 70 (15{\%}) of 457 patients exhibited dMMR. Adjuvant therapy significantly improved DFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.67; 95{\%} CI, 0.48 to 0.93; P = .02) in patients with pMMR tumors. Patients with dMMR tumors receiving FU had no improvement in DFS (HR, 1.10; 95{\%} CI, 0.42 to 2.91; P = .85) compared with those randomly assigned to surgery alone. In the pooled data set of 1,027 patients (n = 165 with dMMR), these findings were maintained; in patients with stage II disease and with dMMR tumors, treatment was associated with reduced overall survival (HR, 2.95; 95{\%} CI, 1.02 to 8.54; P = .04).

CONCLUSION: Patient stratification by MMR status may provide a more tailored approach to colon cancer adjuvant therapy. These data support MMR status assessment for patients being considered for FU therapy alone and consideration of MMR status in treatment decision making.},

@article{Yamamoto2012b,
abstract = {There is an increasing understanding of the roles that microsatellite instability (MSI) plays in Lynch syndrome (by mutations) and sporadic (by mainly epigenetic changes) gastrointestinal (GI) and other cancers. Deficient DNA mismatch repair (MMR) results in the strong mutator phenotype known as MSI, which is the hallmark of cancers arising within Lynch syndrome. MSI is characterized by length alterations within simple repeated sequences called microsatellites. Lynch syndrome occurs primarily because of germline mutations in one of the MMR genes, mainly MLH1 or MSH2, less frequently MSH6, and rarely PMS2. MSI is also observed in about 15{\%} of sporadic colorectal, gastric, and endometrial cancers and in lower frequencies in a minority of other cancers where it is often associated with the hypermethylation of the MLH1 gene. miRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level and are critical in many biological processes and cellular pathways. There is accumulating evidence to support the notion that the interrelationship between MSI and miRNA plays a key role in the pathogenesis of GI cancer. As a possible new mechanism underlying MSI, overexpression of miR-155 has been shown to downregulate expression of MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6. Thus, a subset of MSI-positive (MSI+) cancers without known MMR defects may result from miR-155 overexpression. Target genes of frameshift mutation for MSI are involved in various cellular functions, such as DNA repair, cell signaling, and apoptosis. A novel class of target genes that included not only epigenetic modifier genes, such as HDAC2, but also miRNA processing machinery genes, including TARBP2 and XPO5, were found to be mutated in MSI+ GI cancers. Thus, a subset of MSI+ colorectal cancers (CRCs) has been proposed to exhibit a mutated miRNA machinery phenotype. Genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic differences exist between MSI+ and MSI- cancers. Molecular signatures of miRNA expression apparently have the potential to distinguish between MSI+ and MSI- CRCs. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the MSI pathogenesis of GI cancer, with the focus on its relationship with miRNA as well as on the potential to use MSI and related alterations as biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Colon cancers exhibiting DNA mismatch repair (MMR) defects demonstrate distinct clinical and pathologic features, including better prognosis and reduced response to fluorouracil (FU) -based chemotherapy. This prospective study investigated adjuvant chemotherapy containing FU and irinotecan in patients with MMR deficient (MMR-D) colon cancers.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cancer and Leukemia Group B 89803 randomly assigned 1,264 patients with stage III colon cancer to postoperative weekly bolus FU/leucovorin (LV) or weekly bolus irinotecan, FU, and LV (IFL). The primary end point was overall survival; disease-free survival (DFS) was a secondary end point. Tumor expression of the MMR proteins, MLH1 and MSH2, was determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). DNA microsatellite instability was also assessed using a panel of mono- and dinucleotide markers. Tumors with MMR defects were those demonstrating loss of MMR protein expression (MMR-D) and/or microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) genotype.

RESULTS: Of 723 tumor cases examined by genotyping and IHC, 96 (13.3{\%}) were MMR-D/MSI-H. Genotyping results were consistent with IHC in 702 cases (97.1{\%}). IFL-treated patients with MMR-D/MSI-H tumors showed improved 5-year DFS as compared with those with mismatch repair intact tumors (0.76; 95{\%} CI, 0.64 to 0.88 v 0.59; 95{\%} CI, 0.53 to 0.64; P = .03). This relationship was not observed among patients treated with FU/LV. A trend toward longer DFS was observed in IFL-treated patients with MMR-D/MSI-H tumors as compared with those receiving FU/LV (0.57; 95{\%} CI, 0.42 to 0.71 v 0.76; 95{\%} CI, 0.64 to 0.88; P = .07; hazard ratio interaction between tumor status and treatment, 0.51; likelihood ratio P = .117).

CONCLUSION: Loss of tumor MMR function may predict improved outcome in patients treated with the IFL regimen as compared with those receiving FU/LV.},

@article{Gray2011b,
abstract = {PURPOSE: We developed quantitative gene expression assays to assess recurrence risk and benefits from chemotherapy in patients with stage II colon cancer.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We sought validation by using RNA extracted from fixed paraffin-embedded primary colon tumor blocks from 1,436 patients with stage II colon cancer in the QUASAR (Quick and Simple and Reliable) study of adjuvant fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy versus surgery alone. A recurrence score (RS) and a treatment score (TS) were calculated from gene expression levels of 13 cancer-related genes (n = 7 recurrence genes and n = 6 treatment benefit genes) and from five reference genes with prespecified algorithms. Cox proportional hazards regression models and log-rank methods were used to analyze the relationship between the RS and risk of recurrence in patients treated with surgery alone and between TS and benefits of chemotherapy.

RESULTS: Risk of recurrence was significantly associated with RS (hazard ratio [HR] per interquartile range, 1.38; 95{\%} CI, 1.11 to 1.74; P = .004). Recurrence risks at 3 years were 12{\%}, 18{\%}, and 22{\%} for predefined low, intermediate, and high recurrence risk groups, respectively. T stage (HR, 1.94; P {\textless} .001) and mismatch repair (MMR) status (HR, 0.31; P {\textless} .001) were the strongest histopathologic prognostic factors. The continuous RS was associated with risk of recurrence (P = .006) beyond these and other covariates. There was no trend for increased benefit from chemotherapy at higher TS (P = .95).

CONCLUSION: The continuous 12-gene RS has been validated in a prospective study for assessment of recurrence risk in patients with stage II colon cancer after surgery and provides prognostic value that complements T stage and MMR. The TS was not predictive of chemotherapy benefit.},

abstract = {DNA mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency results in a strong mutator phenotype and high-frequency microsatellite instability (MSI-H), which are the hallmarks of tumors arising within Lynch syndrome. MSI-H is characterized by length alterations within simple repeated sequences, microsatellites. Lynch syndrome is primarily due to germline mutations in one of the DNA MMR genes; mainly hMLH1 or hMSH2 and less frequently hMSH6 and rarely hPMS2. Germline hemiallelic methylation of MLH1, termed epimutation, has been reported to be a new cause of Lynch syndrome. MSI-H is also observed in approximately 15{\%} of colorectal, gastric and endometrial cancers and in lower frequencies in a minority of other tumors, where it is associated with the hypermethylation of the promoter region of hMLH1. MSI-H underlies a distinctive tumorigenic pathway because cancers with MSI-H exhibit many differences in genotype and phenotype relative to cancers without MSI-H, irrespective of their hereditary or sporadic origins. Genetic, epigenetic and transcriptomic differences exist between cancers with and those without the MSI-H. The BRAF V600E mutation is associated with sporadic MSI-H colorectal cancers (CRCs) harboring hMLH1 methylation but not Lynch syndrome-related CRCs. The differences in genotype and phenotype between cancers with and those without MSI-H are likely to be causally linked to their differences in biological and clinical features. Therefore, the diagnosis of MSI-H in cancers is thus considered to be of increasing relevance, because MSI-H is a useful screening marker for identifying patients with Lynch syndrome, a better prognostic factor and could affect the efficacy of chemotherapy. This review addresses recent advances in the field of microsatellite instability research.},
