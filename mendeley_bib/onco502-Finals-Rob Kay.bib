abstract = {Lung cancer is the most common cancer in the world. Despite modern advancements in surgeries, chemotherapies, and radiotherapies over the past few years, lung cancer still remains a very difficult disease to treat. This has left the death rate from lung cancer victims largely unchanged throughout the past few decades. A key cause for the high mortality rate is the drug resistance that builds up for patients being currently treated with the chemotherapeutic agents. Although certain chemotherapeutic agents may initially effectively treat lung cancer patients, there is a high probability that there will be a reoccurrence of the cancer after the patient develops resistance to the drug. Erlotinib, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been approved for localized as well as metastatic non-small cell lung cancer where it seems to be more effective in patients with EGFR mutations. Resistance to erlotinib is a common observation in clinics and this review details our current knowledge on the subject. We discuss the causes of such resistance as well as innovative research to overcome it. Evidently, new chemotherapy strategies are desperately needed in order to better treat lung cancer patients. Current research is investigating alternative treatment plans to enhance the chemotherapy that is already offered. Better insight into the molecular mechanisms behind combination therapy pathways and even single molecular pathways may help improve the efficacy of the current treatment options.},

@article{Wang2012b,
abstract = {PURPOSE: Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells with somatic mutations in epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) are initially susceptible to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI); however, eventually resistance to TKI is developed in these cells, which leads to the failure of treatment. The most common mechanism of this acquired drug resistance is development of a secondary T790M mutation in EGFR. In this study, we investigated the effects of the combination of Erlotinib and Cetuximab on T790M and L858R mutation lung cancer cells lines (H1975), in the primary NSCLC cells with the T790M mutation and TKI-resistant EGFR mutations human tumor xenograft model (H1975).

METHODS: The effects of these two agents on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and EGFR-dependent signaling were evaluated using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, annexin V staining, and Western blotting. Sensitivity of EGFR inhibitors was detected in the primary tumor cell suspension and human tumor xenograft model (H1975).

RESULTS: Compared with single-agent treatment, the combination of Cetuximab and Erlotinib increased apoptosis of EGFR TKI-resistant NSCLC cells (H1975), resulting in more pronounced growth inhibition on cell proliferation and significant inhibition of EGFR-dependent signaling.

CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that treatment with a combination of Erlotinib and Cetuximab overcomes T790M-mediated drug resistance.},

@article{Steiner2007b,
abstract = {PURPOSE: Targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a validated approach to treat cancer. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), EGFR contains somatic mutations in 10{\%} of patients, which correlates with increased response rates to small molecule inhibitors of EGFR. We analyzed the effects of the monoclonal IgG1 antibody Erbitux (cetuximab) in NSCLC xenografts with wild-type (wt) or mutated EGFR.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: NSCLC cell lines were grown s.c. in nude mice. Dose-dependent efficacy was established for cetuximab. To determine whether combination therapy produces tumor regressions, cetuximab was dosed at half-maximal efficacy with chemotherapy used at maximum tolerated dose.

RESULTS: Cetuximab showed antitumor activity in wt (A549, NCI-H358, NCI-H292) and mutated [HCC-827 (delE746-A750), NCI-H1975 (L858R, T790M)] EGFR-expressing xenografts. In the H292 model, cetuximab and docetaxel combination therapy was more potent to inhibit tumor growth than cetuximab or docetaxel alone. Cisplatin augmented efficacy of cetuximab to produce 6 of 10 regressions, whereas 1 of 10 regressions was found with cetuximab and no regression was found with cisplatin. Using H1975 xenografts, gemcitabine increased efficacy of cetuximab resulting in 12 of 12 regressions. Docetaxel with cetuximab was more efficacious with seven of nine regressions compared with single treatments. Cetuximab inhibited autophosphorylation of EGFR in both H292 and H1975 tumor lysates. Exploring the underlying mechanism for combination effects in the H1975 xenograft model, docetaxel in combination with cetuximab added to the antiproliferative effects of cetuximab but was the main component in this drug combination to induce apoptosis.

CONCLUSIONS: Cetuximab showed antitumor activity in NSCLC models expressing wt and mutated EGFR. Combination treatments increased the efficacy of cetuximab, which may be important for the management of patients with chemorefractory NSCLC.},

@article{Kobayashi2005b,
abstract = {Mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene have been identified in non-small cell lung cancer specimens from patients responding to anilinoquinazoline EGFR inhibitors. However, clinical resistance to EGFR inhibitor therapy is commonly observed. Previously, we showed that such resistance can be caused by a second mutation of the EGFR gene, leading to a T790M amino acid change in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain and also found that CL-387,785, a specific and irreversible anilinoquinazoline EGFR inhibitor, was able to overcome this resistance on the biochemical level. Here, we present the successful establishment of a stable Ba/F3 cell line model system for the study of oncogenic EGFR signaling and the functional consequences of the EGFR T790M resistance mutation. We show the ability of gefitinib to induce growth arrest and apoptosis in cells transfected with wild-type or L858R EGFR, whereas the T790M mutation leads to high-level functional resistance against gefitinib and erlotinib. In addition, CL-387,785 is able to overcome resistance caused by the T790M mutation on a functional level, correlating with effective inhibition of downstream signaling pathways. Similar data was also obtained with the use of the gefitinib-resistant H1975 lung cancer cell line. The systems established by us should prove useful for the large-scale screening of alternative EGFR inhibitor compounds against the T790M or other EGFR mutations. These data also support the notion that clinical investigations of compounds similar to CL-387,785 may be useful as a treatment strategy for patients with resistance to EGFR inhibitor therapy caused by the T790M mutation.},

Investigation of the mutational landscape of tumours is providing new insights into cancer genome evolution, laying bare the interplay of somatic mutation, adaptation of clones to their environment and natural selection. These studies have demonstrated the extent of the heterogeneity of cancer genomes, have allowed inferences to be made about the forces that act on nascent cancer clones as they evolve and have shown insight into the mutational processes that generate genetic variation. Here we review our emerging understanding of the dynamic evolution of the cancer genome and of the implications for basic cancer biology and the development of antitumour therapy.},

@article{Perez-Torres2006b,
abstract = {Activating mutations in the kinase domain of the EGF receptor have been reported in non-small cell lung cancer. The majority of tumors expressing these mutants are sensitive to ATP mimetics that inhibit the EGFR tyrosine kinase. The effect of antibodies that bind to the ectodomain of the receptor is less clear. We report herein the effects and mechanisms of action of the antibody cetuximab in lung cancer cells that naturally express receptor mutations and in ErbB-null 32D hematopoietic cells transfected with mutant EGFR. Treatment with cetuximab down-regulated EGFR levels and inhibited cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. This was associated with inhibition of ligand-independent EGFR signaling. These effects were seen in 32D cells arguing the growth inhibitory action was not because of the blockade of autocrine ligand action. Both antibody-induced EGFR down-regulation and inhibition of growth required receptor dimerization as monovalent Fab fragments only eliminated receptor levels or reduced cell proliferation in the presence of antihuman IgG. Finally, cetuximab inhibited growth of H1975 lung cancer cells and xenografts, which expressed L858R/T790M EGFR and were resistant to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. These data suggest that cetuximab is an effective therapy against mutant EGFR-expressing cancer cells and thus can be considered in combination with other anti-EGFR molecules.},
