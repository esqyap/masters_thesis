abstract = {PURPOSE: Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells with somatic mutations in epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) are initially susceptible to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI); however, eventually resistance to TKI is developed in these cells, which leads to the failure of treatment. The most common mechanism of this acquired drug resistance is development of a secondary T790M mutation in EGFR. In this study, we investigated the effects of the combination of Erlotinib and Cetuximab on T790M and L858R mutation lung cancer cells lines (H1975), in the primary NSCLC cells with the T790M mutation and TKI-resistant EGFR mutations human tumor xenograft model (H1975).

METHODS: The effects of these two agents on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and EGFR-dependent signaling were evaluated using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, annexin V staining, and Western blotting. Sensitivity of EGFR inhibitors was detected in the primary tumor cell suspension and human tumor xenograft model (H1975).

RESULTS: Compared with single-agent treatment, the combination of Cetuximab and Erlotinib increased apoptosis of EGFR TKI-resistant NSCLC cells (H1975), resulting in more pronounced growth inhibition on cell proliferation and significant inhibition of EGFR-dependent signaling.

CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that treatment with a combination of Erlotinib and Cetuximab overcomes T790M-mediated drug resistance.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: NanoString's Prosigna™ Breast Cancer Prognostic Gene Signature Assay is based on the PAM50 gene expression signature. The test outputs a risk of recurrence (ROR) score, risk category, and intrinsic subtype (Luminal A/B, HER2-enriched, Basal-like). The studies described here were designed to validate the analytical performance of the test on the nCounter Analysis System across multiple laboratories.

METHODS: Analytical precision was measured by testing five breast tumor RNA samples across 3 sites. Reproducibility was measured by testing replicate tissue sections from 43 FFPE breast tumor blocks across 3 sites following independent pathology review at each site. The RNA input range was validated by comparing assay results at the extremes of the specified range to the nominal RNA input level. Interference was evaluated by including non-tumor tissue into the test.

RESULTS: The measured standard deviation (SD) was less than 1 ROR unit within the analytical precision study and the measured total SD was 2.9 ROR units within the reproducibility study. The ROR scores for RNA inputs at the extremes of the range were the same as those at the nominal input level. Assay results were stable in the presence of moderate amounts of surrounding non-tumor tissue ({\textless}70{\%} by area).

CONCLUSIONS: The analytical performance of NanoString's Prosigna assay has been validated using FFPE breast tumor specimens across multiple clinical testing laboratories.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare clinical, immunohistochemical (IHC), and gene expression models of prognosis applicable to formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded blocks in a large series of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers from patients uniformly treated with adjuvant tamoxifen.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) assays for 50 genes identifying intrinsic breast cancer subtypes were completed on 786 specimens linked to clinical (median follow-up, 11.7 years) and IHC [ER, progesterone receptor (PR), HER2, and Ki67] data. Performance of predefined intrinsic subtype and risk-of-relapse scores was assessed using multivariable Cox models and Kaplan-Meier analysis. Harrell's C-index was used to compare fixed models trained in independent data sets, including proliferation signatures.

RESULTS: Despite clinical ER positivity, 10{\%} of cases were assigned to nonluminal subtypes. qRT-PCR signatures for proliferation genes gave more prognostic information than clinical assays for hormone receptors or Ki67. In Cox models incorporating standard prognostic variables, hazard ratios for breast cancer disease-specific survival over the first 5 years of follow-up, relative to the most common luminal A subtype, are 1.99 [95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 1.09-3.64] for luminal B, 3.65 (95{\%} CI, 1.64-8.16) for HER2-enriched subtype, and 17.71 (95{\%} CI, 1.71-183.33) for the basal-like subtype. For node-negative disease, PAM50 qRT-PCR-based risk assignment weighted for tumor size and proliferation identifies a group with {\textgreater}95{\%} 10-year survival without chemotherapy. In node-positive disease, PAM50-based prognostic models were also superior.

CONCLUSION: The PAM50 gene expression test for intrinsic biological subtype can be applied to large series of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded breast cancers, and gives more prognostic information than clinical factors and IHC using standard cut points.},

abstract = {Chromosomal translocations are critically involved in the molecular pathogenesis of B-cell lymphomas, and highly recurrent and specific rearrangements have defined distinct molecular subtypes linked to unique clinicopathological features. In contrast, several well-characterized lymphoma entities still lack disease-defining translocation events. To identify novel fusion transcripts resulting from translocations, we investigated two Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines by whole-transcriptome paired-end sequencing (RNA-seq). Here we show a highly expressed gene fusion involving the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II transactivator CIITA (MHC2TA) in KM-H2 cells. In a subsequent evaluation of 263 B-cell lymphomas, we also demonstrate that genomic CIITA breaks are highly recurrent in primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (38{\%}) and classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) (15{\%}). Furthermore, we find that CIITA is a promiscuous partner of various in-frame gene fusions, and we report that CIITA gene alterations impact survival in primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL). As functional consequences of CIITA gene fusions, we identify downregulation of surface HLA class II expression and overexpression of ligands of the receptor molecule programmed cell death 1 (CD274/PDL1 and CD273/PDL2). These receptor-ligand interactions have been shown to impact anti-tumour immune responses in several cancers, whereas decreased MHC class II expression has been linked to reduced tumour cell immunogenicity. Thus, our findings suggest that recurrent rearrangements of CIITA may represent a novel genetic mechanism underlying tumour-microenvironment interactions across a spectrum of lymphoid cancers.},

abstract = {B cells may be implicated in the pathophysiology of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), as evidenced by antibody production against sex-mismatched, Y chromosome-encoded minor HLA antigens in association with chronic GVHD. We therefore designed a phase 1/2 study of anti-B-cell therapy with rituximab in steroid-refractory chronic GVHD. Twenty-one patients were treated with 38 cycles of rituximab. Rituximab was tolerated well, and toxicity was limited to infectious events. The clinical response rate was 70{\%}, including 2 patients with complete responses. Responses were limited to patients with cutaneous and musculoskeletal manifestations of chronic GVHD and were durable through 1 year after therapy. The median dose of prednisone among treated subjects fell from 40 mg/day to 10 mg/day, 1 year after rituximab therapy (P {\textless} .001). A chronic GVHD symptom score improved in the majority of treated patients. Antibody titers against Y chromosome-encoded minor HLA antigens fell and remained low, whereas titers against infectious antigens (EBV, tetanus) remained stable or rose during the treatment period. We conclude that specific anti-B-cell therapy with rituximab may be beneficial for patients with steroidrefractory chronic GVHD.

abstract = {Chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells with specificity for CD19 have shown promise in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). It remains to be established whether chimeric antigen receptor T cells have clinical activity in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Two children with relapsed and refractory pre-B-cell ALL received infusions of T cells transduced with anti-CD19 antibody and a T-cell signaling molecule (CTL019 chimeric antigen receptor T cells), at a dose of 1.4×10(6) to 1.2×10(7) CTL019 cells per kilogram of body weight. In both patients, CTL019 T cells expanded to a level that was more than 1000 times as high as the initial engraftment level, and the cells were identified in bone marrow. In addition, the chimeric antigen receptor T cells were observed in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), where they persisted at high levels for at least 6 months. Eight grade 3 or 4 adverse events were noted. The cytokine-release syndrome and B-cell aplasia developed in both patients. In one child, the cytokine-release syndrome was severe; cytokine blockade with etanercept and tocilizumab was effective in reversing the syndrome and did not prevent expansion of chimeric antigen receptor T cells or reduce antileukemic efficacy. Complete remission was observed in both patients and is ongoing in one patient at 11 months after treatment. The other patient had a relapse, with blast cells that no longer expressed CD19, approximately 2 months after treatment. Chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells are capable of killing even aggressive, treatment-refractory acute leukemia cells in vivo. The emergence of tumor cells that no longer express the target indicates a need to target other molecules in addition to CD19 in some patients with ALL.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: Chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) are recombinant receptors that provide both antigen-binding and T-cell-activating functions. A multitude of CARs has been reported over the past decade, targeting an array of cell surface tumor antigens. Their biologic functions have dramatically changed following the introduction of tripartite receptors comprising a costimulatory domain, termed second-generation CARs. These have recently shown clinical benefit in patients treated with CD19-targeted autologous T cells. CARs may be combined with costimulatory ligands, chimeric costimulatory receptors, or cytokines to further enhance T-cell potency, specificity, and safety. CARs represent a new class of drugs with exciting potential for cancer immunotherapy.

SIGNIFICANCE: CARs are a new class of drugs with great potential for cancer immunotherapy. Upon their expression in T lymphocytes, CARs direct potent, targeted immune responses that have recently shown encouraging clinical outcomes in a subset of patients with B-cell malignancies. This review focuses on the design of CARs, including the requirements for optimal antigen recognition and different modalities to provide costimulatory support to targeted T cells, which include the use of second- and third generation CARs, costimulatory ligands, chimeric costimulatory receptors, and cytokines.},

abstract = {In an attempt to treat cancer patients with ERBB2 overexpressing tumors, we developed a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) based on the widely used humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) Trastuzumab (Herceptin). An optimized CAR vector containing CD28, 4-1BB, and CD3zeta signaling moieties was assembled in a gamma-retroviral vector and used to transduce autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) from a patient with colon cancer metastatic to the lungs and liver, refractory to multiple standard treatments. The gene transfer efficiency into autologous T cells was 79{\%} CAR(+) in CD3(+) cells and these cells demonstrated high-specific reactivity in in vitro coculture assays. Following completion of nonmyeloablative conditioning, the patient received 10(10) cells intravenously. Within 15 minutes after cell infusion the patient experienced respiratory distress, and displayed a dramatic pulmonary infiltrate on chest X-ray. She was intubated and despite intensive medical intervention the patient died 5 days after treatment. Serum samples after cell infusion showed marked increases in interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-10, consistent with a cytokine storm. We speculate that the large number of administered cells localized to the lung immediately following infusion and were triggered to release cytokine by the recognition of low levels of ERBB2 on lung epithelial cells.},

abstract = {Activating mutations in the kinase domain of the EGF receptor have been reported in non-small cell lung cancer. The majority of tumors expressing these mutants are sensitive to ATP mimetics that inhibit the EGFR tyrosine kinase. The effect of antibodies that bind to the ectodomain of the receptor is less clear. We report herein the effects and mechanisms of action of the antibody cetuximab in lung cancer cells that naturally express receptor mutations and in ErbB-null 32D hematopoietic cells transfected with mutant EGFR. Treatment with cetuximab down-regulated EGFR levels and inhibited cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. This was associated with inhibition of ligand-independent EGFR signaling. These effects were seen in 32D cells arguing the growth inhibitory action was not because of the blockade of autocrine ligand action. Both antibody-induced EGFR down-regulation and inhibition of growth required receptor dimerization as monovalent Fab fragments only eliminated receptor levels or reduced cell proliferation in the presence of antihuman IgG. Finally, cetuximab inhibited growth of H1975 lung cancer cells and xenografts, which expressed L858R/T790M EGFR and were resistant to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. These data suggest that cetuximab is an effective therapy against mutant EGFR-expressing cancer cells and thus can be considered in combination with other anti-EGFR molecules.},

abstract = {Lung cancer is the most common cancer in the world. Despite modern advancements in surgeries, chemotherapies, and radiotherapies over the past few years, lung cancer still remains a very difficult disease to treat. This has left the death rate from lung cancer victims largely unchanged throughout the past few decades. A key cause for the high mortality rate is the drug resistance that builds up for patients being currently treated with the chemotherapeutic agents. Although certain chemotherapeutic agents may initially effectively treat lung cancer patients, there is a high probability that there will be a reoccurrence of the cancer after the patient develops resistance to the drug. Erlotinib, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been approved for localized as well as metastatic non-small cell lung cancer where it seems to be more effective in patients with EGFR mutations. Resistance to erlotinib is a common observation in clinics and this review details our current knowledge on the subject. We discuss the causes of such resistance as well as innovative research to overcome it. Evidently, new chemotherapy strategies are desperately needed in order to better treat lung cancer patients. Current research is investigating alternative treatment plans to enhance the chemotherapy that is already offered. Better insight into the molecular mechanisms behind combination therapy pathways and even single molecular pathways may help improve the efficacy of the current treatment options.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We critically evaluated the available evidence on genomic tests in breast cancer to define their prognostic ability and likelihood to determine treatment benefit.

DESIGN: Independent evaluation of six genomic tests [Oncotype Dx™, MammaPrint({\textregistered}), Genomic Grade Index, PAM50 (ROR-S), Breast Cancer Index, and EndoPredict] was carried out by a panel of experts in three parameters: analytical validity, clinical validity, and clinical utility based on the principles of the EGAPP criteria. PANEL STATEMENTS: The majority of the working group members found the available evidence on the analytical and clinical validity of Oncotype Dx™ and MammaPrint({\textregistered}) to be convincing. None of the genomic tests demonstrated robust evidence of clinical utility: it was not clear from the current evidence that modifying treatment decisions based on the results of a given genomic test could result in improving clinical outcome.

CONCLUSIONS: The IMPAKT 2012 Working Group proposed the following recommendations: (i) a need to develop models that integrate clinicopathologic factors along with genomic tests; (ii) demonstration of clinical utility should be made in the context of a prospective randomized trial; and (iii) the creation of registries for patients who are subjected to genomic testing in the daily practice.},

abstract = {Allogeneic hematopoietic SCT (HSCT) is an established treatment for some children with life-threatening hematological disease, immune deficiencies and inborn errors of metabolism. Despite advances in prevention and post transplant immuno-suppressive strategies, acute GvHD (aGvHD) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children undergoing SCT. Although reported incidence rates differ, it has been estimated that, depending upon the patient and donor cohort studied, 20-50{\%} of all transplanted patients will experience grade 2 or more aGvHD despite immuno-suppressive prophylaxis. aGvHD occurs when transplanted donor T lymphocytes recognize antigenic disparities between the host and recipient. Pathways other than direct T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity have been shown to be important in the pathogenesis. Inflammatory cytokine release has been implicated as the primary mediator of aGvHD and activation of T cells is one step in the complex process. Deregulated cytokine release by cells other than T cells leads to tissue damage associated with aGvHD. GvHD is a factor that compromises the overall success rate of allogeneic HSCT and remains a challenge, which, in turn, requires an understanding of the pathophysiology, clinical presentation and management of this complication. The authors concentrate on the most recent knowledge of the pathogenesis as well as the classification of aGvHD.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a validated approach to treat cancer. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), EGFR contains somatic mutations in 10{\%} of patients, which correlates with increased response rates to small molecule inhibitors of EGFR. We analyzed the effects of the monoclonal IgG1 antibody Erbitux (cetuximab) in NSCLC xenografts with wild-type (wt) or mutated EGFR.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: NSCLC cell lines were grown s.c. in nude mice. Dose-dependent efficacy was established for cetuximab. To determine whether combination therapy produces tumor regressions, cetuximab was dosed at half-maximal efficacy with chemotherapy used at maximum tolerated dose.

RESULTS: Cetuximab showed antitumor activity in wt (A549, NCI-H358, NCI-H292) and mutated [HCC-827 (delE746-A750), NCI-H1975 (L858R, T790M)] EGFR-expressing xenografts. In the H292 model, cetuximab and docetaxel combination therapy was more potent to inhibit tumor growth than cetuximab or docetaxel alone. Cisplatin augmented efficacy of cetuximab to produce 6 of 10 regressions, whereas 1 of 10 regressions was found with cetuximab and no regression was found with cisplatin. Using H1975 xenografts, gemcitabine increased efficacy of cetuximab resulting in 12 of 12 regressions. Docetaxel with cetuximab was more efficacious with seven of nine regressions compared with single treatments. Cetuximab inhibited autophosphorylation of EGFR in both H292 and H1975 tumor lysates. Exploring the underlying mechanism for combination effects in the H1975 xenograft model, docetaxel in combination with cetuximab added to the antiproliferative effects of cetuximab but was the main component in this drug combination to induce apoptosis.

CONCLUSIONS: Cetuximab showed antitumor activity in NSCLC models expressing wt and mutated EGFR. Combination treatments increased the efficacy of cetuximab, which may be important for the management of patients with chemorefractory NSCLC.},

@article{Sargent2010b,
abstract = {PURPOSE: Prior reports have indicated that patients with colon cancer who demonstrate high-level microsatellite instability (MSI-H) or defective DNA mismatch repair (dMMR) have improved survival and receive no benefit from fluorouracil (FU) -based adjuvant therapy compared with patients who have microsatellite-stable or proficient mismatch repair (pMMR) tumors. We examined MMR status as a predictor of adjuvant therapy benefit in patients with stages II and III colon cancer.

METHODS: MSI assay or immunohistochemistry for MMR proteins were performed on 457 patients who were previously randomly assigned to FU-based therapy (either FU + levamisole or FU + leucovorin; n = 229) versus no postsurgical treatment (n = 228). Data were subsequently pooled with data from a previous analysis. The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS).

RESULTS: Overall, 70 (15{\%}) of 457 patients exhibited dMMR. Adjuvant therapy significantly improved DFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.67; 95{\%} CI, 0.48 to 0.93; P = .02) in patients with pMMR tumors. Patients with dMMR tumors receiving FU had no improvement in DFS (HR, 1.10; 95{\%} CI, 0.42 to 2.91; P = .85) compared with those randomly assigned to surgery alone. In the pooled data set of 1,027 patients (n = 165 with dMMR), these findings were maintained; in patients with stage II disease and with dMMR tumors, treatment was associated with reduced overall survival (HR, 2.95; 95{\%} CI, 1.02 to 8.54; P = .04).

CONCLUSION: Patient stratification by MMR status may provide a more tailored approach to colon cancer adjuvant therapy. These data support MMR status assessment for patients being considered for FU therapy alone and consideration of MMR status in treatment decision making.},

@article{Yamamoto2012b,
abstract = {There is an increasing understanding of the roles that microsatellite instability (MSI) plays in Lynch syndrome (by mutations) and sporadic (by mainly epigenetic changes) gastrointestinal (GI) and other cancers. Deficient DNA mismatch repair (MMR) results in the strong mutator phenotype known as MSI, which is the hallmark of cancers arising within Lynch syndrome. MSI is characterized by length alterations within simple repeated sequences called microsatellites. Lynch syndrome occurs primarily because of germline mutations in one of the MMR genes, mainly MLH1 or MSH2, less frequently MSH6, and rarely PMS2. MSI is also observed in about 15{\%} of sporadic colorectal, gastric, and endometrial cancers and in lower frequencies in a minority of other cancers where it is often associated with the hypermethylation of the MLH1 gene. miRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level and are critical in many biological processes and cellular pathways. There is accumulating evidence to support the notion that the interrelationship between MSI and miRNA plays a key role in the pathogenesis of GI cancer. As a possible new mechanism underlying MSI, overexpression of miR-155 has been shown to downregulate expression of MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6. Thus, a subset of MSI-positive (MSI+) cancers without known MMR defects may result from miR-155 overexpression. Target genes of frameshift mutation for MSI are involved in various cellular functions, such as DNA repair, cell signaling, and apoptosis. A novel class of target genes that included not only epigenetic modifier genes, such as HDAC2, but also miRNA processing machinery genes, including TARBP2 and XPO5, were found to be mutated in MSI+ GI cancers. Thus, a subset of MSI+ colorectal cancers (CRCs) has been proposed to exhibit a mutated miRNA machinery phenotype. Genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic differences exist between MSI+ and MSI- cancers. Molecular signatures of miRNA expression apparently have the potential to distinguish between MSI+ and MSI- CRCs. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the MSI pathogenesis of GI cancer, with the focus on its relationship with miRNA as well as on the potential to use MSI and related alterations as biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets.},

This prospective study investigated adjuvant chemotherapy containing FU and irinotecan in patients with MMR deficient (MMR-D) colon cancers.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cancer and Leukemia Group B 89803 randomly assigned 1,264 patients with stage III colon cancer to postoperative weekly bolus FU/leucovorin (LV) or weekly bolus irinotecan, FU, and LV (IFL). The primary end point was overall survival; disease-free survival (DFS) was a secondary end point. Tumor expression of the MMR proteins, MLH1 and MSH2, was determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). DNA microsatellite instability was also assessed using a panel of mono- and dinucleotide markers. Tumors with MMR defects were those demonstrating loss of MMR protein expression (MMR-D) and/or microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) genotype.

RESULTS: Of 723 tumor cases examined by genotyping and IHC, 96 (13.3{\%}) were MMR-D/MSI-H. Genotyping results were consistent with IHC in 702 cases (97.1{\%}). IFL-treated patients with MMR-D/MSI-H tumors showed improved 5-year DFS as compared with those with mismatch repair intact tumors (0.76; 95{\%} CI, 0.64 to 0.88 v 0.59; 95{\%} CI, 0.53 to 0.64; P = .03). This relationship was not observed among patients treated with FU/LV. A trend toward longer DFS was observed in IFL-treated patients with MMR-D/MSI-H tumors as compared with those receiving FU/LV (0.57; 95{\%} CI, 0.42 to 0.71 v 0.76; 95{\%} CI, 0.64 to 0.88; P = .07; hazard ratio interaction between tumor status and treatment, 0.51; likelihood ratio P = .117).

CONCLUSION: Loss of tumor MMR function may predict improved outcome in patients treated with the IFL regimen as compared with those receiving FU/LV.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: PURPOSE To improve on current standards for breast cancer prognosis and prediction of chemotherapy benefit by developing a risk model that incorporates the gene expression-based "intrinsic" subtypes luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched, and basal-like. METHODS A 50-gene subtype predictor was developed using microarray and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction data from 189 prototype samples. Test sets from 761 patients (no systemic therapy) were evaluated for prognosis, and 133 patients were evaluated for prediction of pathologic complete response (pCR) to a taxane and anthracycline regimen.

RESULTS: The intrinsic subtypes as discrete entities showed prognostic significance (P = 2.26E-12) and remained significant in multivariable analyses that incorporated standard parameters (estrogen receptor status, histologic grade, tumor size, and node status). A prognostic model for node-negative breast cancer was built using intrinsic subtype and clinical information. The C-index estimate for the combined model (subtype and tumor size) was a significant improvement on either the clinicopathologic model or subtype model alone. The intrinsic subtype model predicted neoadjuvant chemotherapy efficacy with a negative predictive value for pCR of 97{\%}. CONCLUSION Diagnosis by intrinsic subtype adds significant prognostic and predictive information to standard parameters for patients with breast cancer.

abstract = {The BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are responsible for a high proportion of familial breast cancer; germline mutations in these genes confer a lifetime risk of about 70{\%} for developing breast cancer. Most of the described deleterious mutations are small deletions or insertions that originate a truncated protein; however, in many cases, they are amino acid changes whose significance is unknown. In these cases, there are some tests that can analyze the meaning of these variants, but most remain unclassified. The BRCA genes are tumor suppressors and it is believed that complete loss of the wild-type allele is a common mechanism of inactivation in tumors from patients carrying a germline deleterious mutation in these genes; if this is true, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis in the tumor sample could help to distinguish if a rare variant is either a deleterious mutation or a common polymorphism. In the present study, we performed LOH analysis at the BRCA loci in 47 tumors from patients who belonged to high-risk breast cancer families and were carriers of any type of alteration in these genes. Our results suggest that (i) loss of the wild-type allele is the most common mechanism of inactivation in tumors from patients who carry a deleterious mutation in any of the genes, (ii) this loss is not common when we analyze familial tumors not associated with mutations in BRCA and (iii) LOH can be used to clarify variants of unknown significance in the BRCA genes.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: We developed quantitative gene expression assays to assess recurrence risk and benefits from chemotherapy in patients with stage II colon cancer.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We sought validation by using RNA extracted from fixed paraffin-embedded primary colon tumor blocks from 1,436 patients with stage II colon cancer in the QUASAR (Quick and Simple and Reliable) study of adjuvant fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy versus surgery alone. A recurrence score (RS) and a treatment score (TS) were calculated from gene expression levels of 13 cancer-related genes (n = 7 recurrence genes and n = 6 treatment benefit genes) and from five reference genes with prespecified algorithms. Cox proportional hazards regression models and log-rank methods were used to analyze the relationship between the RS and risk of recurrence in patients treated with surgery alone and between TS and benefits of chemotherapy.

RESULTS: Risk of recurrence was significantly associated with RS (hazard ratio [HR] per interquartile range, 1.38; 95{\%} CI, 1.11 to 1.74; P = .004). Recurrence risks at 3 years were 12{\%}, 18{\%}, and 22{\%} for predefined low, intermediate, and high recurrence risk groups, respectively. T stage (HR, 1.94; P {\textless} .001) and mismatch repair (MMR) status (HR, 0.31; P {\textless} .001) were the strongest histopathologic prognostic factors. The continuous RS was associated with risk of recurrence (P = .006) beyond these and other covariates. There was no trend for increased benefit from chemotherapy at higher TS (P = .95).

CONCLUSION: The continuous 12-gene RS has been validated in a prospective study for assessment of recurrence risk in patients with stage II colon cancer after surgery and provides prognostic value that complements T stage and MMR. The TS was not predictive of chemotherapy benefit.},

abstract = {DNA mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency results in a strong mutator phenotype and high-frequency microsatellite instability (MSI-H), which are the hallmarks of tumors arising within Lynch syndrome. MSI-H is characterized by length alterations within simple repeated sequences, microsatellites. Lynch syndrome is primarily due to germline mutations in one of the DNA MMR genes; mainly hMLH1 or hMSH2 and less frequently hMSH6 and rarely hPMS2. Germline hemiallelic methylation of MLH1, termed epimutation, has been reported to be a new cause of Lynch syndrome. MSI-H is also observed in approximately 15{\%} of colorectal, gastric and endometrial cancers and in lower frequencies in a minority of other tumors, where it is associated with the hypermethylation of the promoter region of hMLH1. MSI-H underlies a distinctive tumorigenic pathway because cancers with MSI-H exhibit many differences in genotype and phenotype relative to cancers without MSI-H, irrespective of their hereditary or sporadic origins. Genetic, epigenetic and transcriptomic differences exist between cancers with and those without the MSI-H. The BRAF V600E mutation is associated with sporadic MSI-H colorectal cancers (CRCs) harboring hMLH1 methylation but not Lynch syndrome-related CRCs. The differences in genotype and phenotype between cancers with and those without MSI-H are likely to be causally linked to their differences in biological and clinical features. Therefore, the diagnosis of MSI-H in cancers is thus considered to be of increasing relevance, because MSI-H is a useful screening marker for identifying patients with Lynch syndrome, a better prognostic factor and could affect the efficacy of chemotherapy. This review addresses recent advances in the field of microsatellite instability research.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The 21-gene recurrence score (RS) assay quantifies the likelihood of distant recurrence in women with estrogen receptor-positive, lymph node-negative breast cancer treated with adjuvant tamoxifen. The relationship between the RS and chemotherapy benefit is not known.

METHODS: The RS was measured in tumors from the tamoxifen-treated and tamoxifen plus chemotherapy-treated patients in the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B20 trial. Cox proportional hazards models were utilized to test for interaction between chemotherapy treatment and the RS.

RESULTS: A total of 651 patients were assessable (227 randomly assigned to tamoxifen and 424 randomly assigned to tamoxifen plus chemotherapy). The test for interaction between chemotherapy treatment and RS was statistically significant (P = .038). Patients with high-RS ({\textgreater} or = 31) tumors (ie, high risk of recurrence) had a large benefit from chemotherapy (relative risk, 0.26; 95{\%} CI, 0.13 to 0.53; absolute decrease in 10-year distant recurrence rate: mean, 27.6{\%}; SE, 8.0{\%}). Patients with low-RS ({\textless} 18) tumors derived minimal, if any, benefit from chemotherapy treatment (relative risk, 1.31; 95{\%} CI, 0.46 to 3.78; absolute decrease in distant recurrence rate at 10 years: mean, -1.1{\%}; SE, 2.2{\%}). Patients with intermediate-RS tumors did not appear to have a large benefit, but the uncertainty in the estimate can not exclude a clinically important benefit.

CONCLUSION: The RS assay not only quantifies the likelihood of breast cancer recurrence in women with node-negative, estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, but also predicts the magnitude of chemotherapy benefit.},

abstract = {Chronic graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality of long-term survivors of allogeneic hemato-poietic cell transplantation (HCT). Chronic GVHD can have features of an autoimmune collagen vascular disease with clinical manifestations similar to autoimmune scleroderma and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, the pathogenesis of chronic GVHD is poorly understood. It is unclear how autoreactive T and B cells are generated in chronic GVHD recipients. We have recently developed a new chronic GVHD model by transplantation of donor DBA/2 (H-2d) spleen cells into major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-matched but minor antigen-mismatched sublethally irradiated BALB/c (H-2d) recipients as well as athymic BALB/c(nu/nu) and adult-thymectomized BALB/c recipients. Both euthymic and athymic BALB/c recipients developed high levels of serum IgG autoantibodies, sclerodermatous skin damage, and glomerulonephritis. Disease induction required both donor CD25-CD4+ T and B cells in transplants. In contrast, donor CD25+CD4+ T regulatory (Treg) cells prevented the disease induction. These results indicate that host thymus is not required for induction of chronic GVHD and that quiescent autoreactive T and B cells in transplants from nonautoimmune donors may be activated and expanded to cause chronic GVHD with autoimmune manifestations in allogeneic recipients, and donor Treg cells can suppress this process.},

All patients received myeloablative regimens including 12 Gy total body irradiation. We analyzed the hematologic recovery, and risks of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), transplantation-related mortality (TRM) and relapse, and disease-free survival (DFS) using Cox proportional hazards models. Significant delays in engraftment occurred after cord blood transplantation; however, overall engraftment rates were almost the same for both grafts. The cumulative incidences of grades III to IV acute and extensive-type chronic GVHDs among CBT recipients were significantly lower than those among BMT/PBSCT recipients. Multivariate analysis demonstrated no apparent differences in TRM (9{\%} in CBT and 13{\%} in BMT/PBSCT recipients), relapse (17{\%} in CBT and 26{\%} in BMT/PBSCT recipients), and DFS (70{\%} in CBT and 60{\%} in BMT/PBSCT recipients) between both groups.

abstract = {PURPOSE: Recent studies suggest that donor B cells as well as T cells contribute to immune pathology in patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). B-cell activating factor (BAFF) promotes survival and differentiation of activated B cells. Thus, we tested whether BAFF correlated with chronic GVHD disease activity and time of onset after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients who had undergone allogeneic HSCT between 1994 and 2005 for hematologic malignancies were studied. ELISA was used to measure plasma BAFF levels and flow cytometry was used to assess BAFF receptor expression on B cells in patients with or without chronic GVHD.

RESULTS: In 104 patients, BAFF levels were significantly higher in patients with active chronic GVHD compared with those without disease (P = 0.02 and 0.0004, respectively). Treatment with high-dose prednisone ({\textgreater}or=30 mg/d) was associated with reduced BAFF levels in patients with active chronic GVHD (P = 0.0005). Serial studies in 24 patients showed that BAFF levels were high in the first 3 months after HSCT but subsequently decreased in 13 patients who never developed chronic GVHD. In contrast, BAFF levels remained elevated in 11 patients who developed chronic GVHD. Six-month BAFF levels {\textgreater}or=10 ng/mL were strongly associated with subsequent development of chronic GVHD (P {\textless} 0.0001). Following transplant, plasma BAFF levels correlated inversely with BAFF receptor expression on B cells (P = 0.01), suggesting that soluble BAFF affected B cells through this receptor.

CONCLUSION: These results suggest that elevated BAFF levels contribute to B-cell activation in patients with active chronic GVHD.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Myelomonocytic acute myeloid leukemia (M4-AML) is frequently associated with the cytogenetic marker inv(16) and/or the presence of eosinophilia. The aim of this study was to analyze the incidence and prognostic role of these factors in a large series of patients.

DESIGN AND METHODS: Adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia consecutively enrolled in the GIMEMA trials AML10 and LAM99p were retrospectively analyzed.

RESULTS: Among 1686 patients, 400 cases of M4-AML were identified; of these, 78{\%} had neither eosinophilia nor inv(16), 6{\%} had eosinophilia only, 8{\%} had inv(16) only and 8{\%} had both. Univariate analysis showed that both eosinophilia and inv(16) were correlated with a higher probability of complete remission, lower resistance to chemotherapy and increased overall survival. Multivariate analysis showed that the simultaneous presence of the two factors significantly increased the probabilities of both complete remission and overall survival. The presence of only one of the two factors also increased the probabilities of complete remission and overall survival, but not to a statistically significant extent. The relapse-free survival of the responding patients was not influenced by the two factors.

CONCLUSIONS: In a large series of patients with M4-AML we confirmed the favorable role of inv(16), but the weight of this factor among the whole M4 population was of limited relevance. Eosinophilia, which affects a small proportion of cases, also emerged as a favorable prognostic factor. Based on the results of this large case population, overall and relapse-free survival rates of patients with M4-AML are not significantly better than those of patients with non-M4 AML, while the concomitant presence of both inv(16) and eosinophilia was associated with a significantly improved prognosis.},

abstract = {Mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene have been identified in non-small cell lung cancer specimens from patients responding to anilinoquinazoline EGFR inhibitors. However, clinical resistance to EGFR inhibitor therapy is commonly observed. Previously, we showed that such resistance can be caused by a second mutation of the EGFR gene, leading to a T790M amino acid change in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain and also found that CL-387,785, a specific and irreversible anilinoquinazoline EGFR inhibitor, was able to overcome this resistance on the biochemical level. Here, we present the successful establishment of a stable Ba/F3 cell line model system for the study of oncogenic EGFR signaling and the functional consequences of the EGFR T790M resistance mutation. We show the ability of gefitinib to induce growth arrest and apoptosis in cells transfected with wild-type or L858R EGFR, whereas the T790M mutation leads to high-level functional resistance against gefitinib and erlotinib. In addition, CL-387,785 is able to overcome resistance caused by the T790M mutation on a functional level, correlating with effective inhibition of downstream signaling pathways. Similar data was also obtained with the use of the gefitinib-resistant H1975 lung cancer cell line. The systems established by us should prove useful for the large-scale screening of alternative EGFR inhibitor compounds against the T790M or other EGFR mutations. These data also support the notion that clinical investigations of compounds similar to CL-387,785 may be useful as a treatment strategy for patients with resistance to EGFR inhibitor therapy caused by the T790M mutation.},
