abstract = {Accurate DNA replication and repair is essential for proper development, growth and tumor-free survival in all multicellular organisms. A key requirement for the maintenance of genomic integrity is the availability of adequate and balanced pools of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), the building blocks of DNA. Notably, dNTP pool alterations lead to genomic instability and have been linked to multiple human diseases, including mitochondrial disorders, susceptibility to viral infection and cancer. In this review, we discuss how a key regulator of dNTP biosynthesis in mammals, the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), impacts cancer susceptibility and serves as a target for anti-cancer therapies. Because RNR-regulated dNTP production can influence DNA replication fidelity while also supporting genome-protecting DNA repair, RNR has complex and stage-specific roles in carcinogenesis. Nevertheless, cancer cells are dependent on RNR for de novo dNTP biosynthesis. Therefore, elevated RNR expression is a characteristic of many cancers, and an array of mechanistically distinct RNR inhibitors serve as effective agents for cancer treatment. The dNTP metabolism machinery, including RNR, has been exploited for therapeutic benefit for decades and remains an important target for cancer drug development.Oncogene advance online publication, 9 June 2014; doi:10.1038/onc.2014.155.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to confirm that RRM2 as a novel target of HPVE7 involved in cervical cancer angiogenesis.

METHODS: Gene expression was analysed by RT-qPCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry in cervical cancer tissue and cell lines. Luciferase reporter assay was used to determine the activities of various RRM2 promoters. Secreted VEGF was measured by ELISA. RRM2-mediated capillary tube formation induced by HPVE7 in cervical cancer cells were evaluated using human umbilical vein endothelial cells in vitro. ROS induced by RRM2 in cercal cancer cells was confirmed by flow cytometry. The growth of cervical cancer cell overexpression RRM2 was examined by nude mouse xenograft.

RESULTS: RRM2 as a novel downstream target for HPVE7 was upregulated by it at the transcriptional level through the E7-pRb interaction and binding of E2F to the RRM2 promoter region. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the level of RRM2 positively correlated with the HPVE7 level in human cervical cancer. Functionally, overexpression of RRM2 enhanced the expression of HIF-1$\alpha$ and VEGF via activation of the ERK1/2 signalling pathway in cervical cancer cells, and significantly associated with increased microvessel densities in cervical cancer tissues. In vitro, HPVE7 stimulated RRM2-dependent capillary tube formation by HUVECs, and RRM2-enhanced angiogenesis was VEGF dependent. RRM2-activated ERK1/2 pathway was mediated through production of ROS. In the xenograft mouse model, overexpression of RRM2 in cervical cancer cells enhanced tumour growth as well as microvessel densities.

CONCLUSION: HPVE7 induces upregulation of RRM2, which then promotes cervical carcinogenesis via ROS-ERK1/2-HIF-1$\alpha$-VEGF-induced angiogenesis. Thus, the inhibition of RRM2 activity may be a novel therapeutic strategy for human cervical cancer.},

abstract = {Human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 is involved in causing cervical cancer. The E6 and E7 proteins of HPV 16 immortalize human keratinocytes and this is due, at least in part, to inactivation of the tumor suppressor proteins p53 and pRB. These tumor suppressor proteins also regulate the expression of pro- and antiangiogenic factors by cells. For this reason, experiments were conducted to determine whether the expression of E6 and E7 in primary keratinocytes alters the phenotype of these cells such that they express diminished levels of antiangiogenic factors and/or increased levels of proangiogenic factors. To avoid variances in experimental observations, pools of human foreskin keratinocytes from multiple sources were infected with recombinant retrovirus expressing HPV 16 E6 and E7 or control retrovirus. Gene array analysis, RT-PCR, ELISAs and Western blotting showed that in cells expressing HPV 16 E6 and E7, expression levels of two potent angiogenesis inhibitors, thrombospondin-1 and maspin, were lower compared to controls. Additionally, major angiogenesis inducers, interleukin-8 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), were increased relative to controls. VEGF can be produced as multiple splice variants, all of which are required for the formation of patent blood vessels. The expression of HPV 16 E6 and E7 in keratinocytes augmented expression of VEGF 121, 145, 165 and 189. These observations show that HPV 16 E6 and E7 alter the phenotype of primary keratinocytes, diminishing expression of inhibitors and increasing expression of inducers of angiogenesis. This altered phenotype may permit keratinocytes infected by HPV 16 to play a role in the progression of cancer by permitting tumors to acquire a blood supply permissive of growth and spread.},
