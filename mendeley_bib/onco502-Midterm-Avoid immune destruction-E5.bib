@article{Ashrafi2006c,
abstract = {Human papillomavirus type 16 E5 protein (HPV-16 E5) is expressed early in papillomavirus infection and is localised primarily in the cell Golgi apparatus (GA) and endoplasmic reticulum. E5 prevents transport of the major histocompatibility class I (MHC I; HLA class I in humans) to the cell surface and retains the complex in the GA. We report that these effects are due, at least in part, to the interaction between E5 and HLA I heavy chain (HC). We also demonstrate that the down-regulation of surface HLA I and interaction with HC are mediated by the first hydrophobic domain of E5. Although E5 downregulates classical HLA selectively as it does not downregulate non-classical HLA, the interaction with the HC of classical HLA I is not specific for a particular haplotype of HLA I. This suggests that E5 can interfere with antigen presentation by most, if not all, classical HLA I haplotypes, with potentially serious consequences as the ability of infected cells to present antigenic peptides to effector T cells would be compromised.},

@article{Campo2010c,
abstract = {HPV-16 is the major causes of cervical cancer. Persistence of infection is a necessary event for progression of the infection to cancer. Among other factors, virus persistence is due the viral proteins fighting the immune response. HPV-16 E5 down-regulates MHC/HLA class I, which is much reduced on the cell surface and accumulates in the Golgi apparatus in cells expressing E5. This effect is observed also in W12 cells, which mimic early cervical intraepithelial progression to cervical cancer. The functional effect of MHC I down-regulation on human CD8 T cells is not known, because of the need for HLA-matched, HPV-specific T cells that recognise E5 expressing-cells. Here we employ a heterologous cell/MHC I system which uses mouse cells expressing both E5 and HLA-A2, and A2-restricted CTLs; we show that the E5-induced reduction of HLA-A2 has a functional impact by reducing recognition of E5 expressing cells by HPV specific CD8+ T cells.},

@article{Regan2008c,
abstract = {The E5 proteins of human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are small hydrophobic proteins that are expressed in the early and late stages of the viral life cycle; however, their role in HPV pathogenesis is not clearly understood. In this study, a split-ubiquitin yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) two-hybrid system was used to identify B-cell-associated protein 31 (Bap31) as a binding partner of HPV E5 proteins. The association of these proteins was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation of complexes of Bap31 with either HPV type 16 (HPV16) or HPV31 E5. In addition, Bap31 and E5 were found to colocalize in perinuclear patterns consistent with localization to the endoplasmic reticulum. Mutational analysis of E5 identified amino acids in the extreme C terminus as important for stabilizing the interaction with Bap31. Deletion of these C-terminal amino acids of E5 in the context of complete HPV31 genomes resulted in impaired proliferative capacity of HPV-positive keratinocytes following differentiation. When small interfering RNAs were used to reduce the levels of Bap31, the proliferative ability of HPV-positive keratinocytes upon differentiation was also reduced, implicating Bap31 as a regulator of this process. These studies identify a novel binding partner of the high-risk HPV E5 proteins and provide insight into how the E5 proteins may modulate the life cycle in differentiating cells.},
