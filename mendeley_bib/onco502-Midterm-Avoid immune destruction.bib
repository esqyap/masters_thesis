abstract = {Greater than 95{\%} of all cervical carcinomas have been found to be associated with "high-risk" human papillomavirus (mainly types 16 and 18) infections, with the viral E6 and E7 oncoproteins essential for neoplastic development and maintenance. Interferon-alpha (IFNalpha) is used in the treatment of HPV infections yet both in vivo and in vitro data suggest that the virus has developed mechanisms to avoid the effects of interferon. Here we show that the HPV16 E7 oncoprotein is able to inhibit the induction of IFNalpha-inducible genes but has no effect of IFNgamma-inducible genes. Expression of E7 correlates with the loss of formation of the interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) transcription complex. Moreover, in the presence of E7, p48, the DNA-binding component of ISGF3, was unable to translocate to the nucleus upon IFNalpha stimulation. A direct protein-protein interaction was identified between E7 and p48 with the site of interaction within E7 defined as the region between amino acids 17-37, a domain that includes the binding site for the retinoblastoma protein, pRb. These results suggest that HPV, via E7, targets p48, resulting in the loss of IFNalpha-mediated signal transduction and may provide a means by which HPV can avoid the innate immune system.},

abstract = {Human papillomavirus type 16 E5 protein (HPV-16 E5) is expressed early in papillomavirus infection and is localised primarily in the cell Golgi apparatus (GA) and endoplasmic reticulum. E5 prevents transport of the major histocompatibility class I (MHC I; HLA class I in humans) to the cell surface and retains the complex in the GA. We report that these effects are due, at least in part, to the interaction between E5 and HLA I heavy chain (HC). We also demonstrate that the down-regulation of surface HLA I and interaction with HC are mediated by the first hydrophobic domain of E5. Although E5 downregulates classical HLA selectively as it does not downregulate non-classical HLA, the interaction with the HC of classical HLA I is not specific for a particular haplotype of HLA I. This suggests that E5 can interfere with antigen presentation by most, if not all, classical HLA I haplotypes, with potentially serious consequences as the ability of infected cells to present antigenic peptides to effector T cells would be compromised.},

abstract = {HPV-16 is the major causes of cervical cancer. Persistence of infection is a necessary event for progression of the infection to cancer. Among other factors, virus persistence is due the viral proteins fighting the immune response. HPV-16 E5 down-regulates MHC/HLA class I, which is much reduced on the cell surface and accumulates in the Golgi apparatus in cells expressing E5. This effect is observed also in W12 cells, which mimic early cervical intraepithelial progression to cervical cancer. The functional effect of MHC I down-regulation on human CD8 T cells is not known, because of the need for HLA-matched, HPV-specific T cells that recognise E5 expressing-cells. Here we employ a heterologous cell/MHC I system which uses mouse cells expressing both E5 and HLA-A2, and A2-restricted CTLs; we show that the E5-induced reduction of HLA-A2 has a functional impact by reducing recognition of E5 expressing cells by HPV specific CD8+ T cells.},

abstract = {High-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) infect stratified epithelia to establish persistent infections that maintain low-copy-number episomes in infected basal cells. Amplification of viral genomes occurs upon keratinocyte differentiation, followed by virion synthesis. During persistent HPV infections, viral proteins act to evade surveillance by both innate and adaptive immune responses. One of the primary pathways regulating the innate immune response is the JAK/STAT pathway. Our studies indicate that the expression of STAT-1, but not other members of interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF-3) complex such as STAT-2 and IFN regulatory factor 9 (IRF9), is selectively suppressed by HPV proteins at the level of transcription. Both E6 and E7 oncoproteins independently suppress the expression of STAT-1, and mutational analyses indicate that the E6 targeting E6-associated protein (E6AP) is responsible for suppression. The levels of STAT-1 proteins increase upon differentiation of both normal and HPV-positive cells but are still significantly reduced in the latter cells. Transient restoration of STAT-1 levels in HPV-positive cells using recombinant retroviruses significantly impaired viral amplification upon differentiation while long-term increases abrogated maintenance of episomes. Similarly, increased levels of STAT-1 induced by gamma interferon treatment inhibited HPV genome amplification upon differentiation. Overall, our findings demonstrate that suppression of STAT-1 expression by HPV proteins is necessary for genome amplification and maintenance of episomes, suggesting an important role for this activity in viral pathogenesis.},

@article{Reiser2011b,
abstract = {Persistent infections with human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16), HPV18, or HPV31 are necessary for the development of cervical cancer, implying that HPVs have evolved immunoevasive mechanisms. Recent global transcriptome analyses indicated that these HPV types downregulate the constitutive expression of interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes (ISGs), but the underlying mechanism is not well understood. Comparative analyses of ISG transcription in keratinocytes with complete HPV16, -18, and -31 genomes revealed that antiviral genes (IFIT1 and MX1), genes involved in IFN signaling (STAT1), proapoptotic genes (TRAIL and XAF1), and pathogen recognition receptors (TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA5) are inhibited to similar extents by HPV16, -18, and -31. The lower expression of pathogen receptors in HPV-positive cells correlated with a greatly impaired induction of IFN-$\beta$ and also of IFN-$\lambda$1, -2, and -3 upon receptor stimulation. IFN-$\kappa$ is constitutively expressed in normal keratinocytes and is strongly repressed by HPV16, -18, and -31. ISGs downregulated in HPV-positive cells can be reactivated by IFN-$\kappa$ expression. The viral E6 and E7 oncogenes are sufficient for IFN-$\kappa$ repression, with E6 being mainly responsible. E6 inhibits IFN-$\kappa$ transcription independently from binding to PDZ proteins. IFN-$\kappa$ expression can be activated in only one cell line by E6AP knockdown but can be activated in all tested HPV-positive cells by addition of a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, suggesting that HPVs modulate DNA methylation. Taken together, these results suggest that carcinogenic HPVs target IFN-$\kappa$ by different pathways in keratinocytes to inhibit both antiviral ISGs and pathogen recognition receptors, which in turn reduces the expression of inducible IFNs.},

@article{Takaoka2006c,
abstract = {Interferons (IFNs) elicit multifaceted effects in host innate defence. Accumulating evidence revealed that not only the first identified Jak-Stat pathway but also other newly found signalling pathways are required for the induction of versatile responses by IFNs. In particular, type I IFNs are inducible by viral infection through the recognition of pathogen-associated molecules by pattern recognition receptors, and the induction of multiple IFN-stimulated genes through the activation of type I IFN signalling confers antiviral and immunomodulatory activities. Any step in this process is often targeted by viruses for their immuno-evasion. The regulatory function of constitutive IFN-alpha/beta signalling has been recognized in terms of its boosting effect on cellular responsiveness in host defence systems. Further comprehensive understanding of IFN signalling may offer a better direction to unravelling the complex signalling networks in the host defence system, and may contribute to their more effective therapeutic applications.},

@article{Regan2008c,
abstract = {The E5 proteins of human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are small hydrophobic proteins that are expressed in the early and late stages of the viral life cycle; however, their role in HPV pathogenesis is not clearly understood. In this study, a split-ubiquitin yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) two-hybrid system was used to identify B-cell-associated protein 31 (Bap31) as a binding partner of HPV E5 proteins. The association of these proteins was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation of complexes of Bap31 with either HPV type 16 (HPV16) or HPV31 E5. In addition, Bap31 and E5 were found to colocalize in perinuclear patterns consistent with localization to the endoplasmic reticulum. Mutational analysis of E5 identified amino acids in the extreme C terminus as important for stabilizing the interaction with Bap31. Deletion of these C-terminal amino acids of E5 in the context of complete HPV31 genomes resulted in impaired proliferative capacity of HPV-positive keratinocytes following differentiation. When small interfering RNAs were used to reduce the levels of Bap31, the proliferative ability of HPV-positive keratinocytes upon differentiation was also reduced, implicating Bap31 as a regulator of this process. These studies identify a novel binding partner of the high-risk HPV E5 proteins and provide insight into how the E5 proteins may modulate the life cycle in differentiating cells.},
