abstract = {BACKGROUND: Infection with high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) such as HPV-16 is intimately associated with squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) of the anogenital tract and a subset of oropharyngeal carcinomas. Such lesions, including pre-invasive precursors, frequently show multipolar mitoses and aneuploidy. The high-risk HPV-16-encoded E7 oncoprotein has been shown to rapidly induce centrosome abnormalities thereby causing the formation of supernumerary mitotic spindle poles and increasing the risk for chromosome missegregation. HPV-16 E7 has been found to rapidly induce centriole overduplication, in part, through the simultaneous formation of more than one daughter centriole at single maternal centrioles (centriole multiplication). The precise molecular mechanism that underlies HPV-16 E7-induced centriole multiplication, however, remains poorly understood.

FINDINGS: Here, we show that human keratinocytes engineered to stably express the HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein exhibit aberrant Polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4) protein expression at maternal centrioles. Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase (qRT-PCR) analysis of these cells revealed an increase of PLK4 mRNA levels compared to control cells. Importantly, the ability of the HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein to induce centriole multiplication was found to correlate with its ability to activate the PLK4 promoter and to up-regulate PLK4 mRNA.

CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the critical role of PLK4 transcriptional deregulation in centriole multiplication in HPV-16 E7-expressing cells. Our findings encourage further experiments to test transcriptional inhibitors or small molecules targeting PLK4 to prevent centriole abnormalities, mitotic infidelity and malignant progression in HPV-associated neoplasms and other tumors in which PLK4 regulation is disrupted.},

abstract = {High-risk HPV-associated anal neoplasms are difficult to treat and biomarkers of malignant progression are needed. A hallmark of carcinogenic progression is genomic instability, which is frequently associated with cell division errors and aneuploidy. The HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein has been previously shown to rapidly induce centriole and centrosome overduplication and to cooperate with HPV-16 E6 in the induction of abnormal multipolar mitoses. Based on this function, it has been suggested that HPV-16 E7 may act as a driving force for chromosomal instability. However, a detailed analysis of centrosome overduplication in primary HPV-associated neoplasms has not been performed so far. Here, we determined the frequency of centrosome overduplication in HPV-associated anal lesions using a recently identified marker for mature maternal centrioles, Cep170. We detected centrosome overduplication in a small but significant fraction of cells. Remarkably, centrosome overduplication, but not aberrant centrosome numbers per se or centrosome accumulation, correlated significantly with the presence of cell division errors. In addition, our experiments revealed that in particular pseudo-bipolar mitoses may play a role in the propagation of chromosomal instability in high-risk HPV-associated tumors. These results provide new insights into the role of centrosome aberrations in cell division errors and encourage further studies on centrosome overduplication as a predictive biomarker of malignant progression in HPV-associated anal lesions.},

abstract = {Infection with certain types of human papillomaviruses (HPV) is highly associated with carcinomas of the human uterine cervix. However, HPV infection alone does not appear to be sufficient for the process of malignant transformation, suggesting the requirement of additional cellular events. After DNA damage, normal mammalian cells exhibit G1 cell-cycle arrest and inhibition of replicative DNA synthesis. This mechanism, which requires wild-type p53, presumably allows cells to undertake DNA repair and avoid the fixation of mutations. We directly tested whether the normal response of cervical epithelial cells to DNA damage may be undermined by interactions between the E6 protein expressed by oncogenic HPV types and wild-type p53. We treated primary keratinocytes with the DNA-damaging agent actinomycin D and demonstrated inhibition of replicative DNA synthesis and a significant increase in p53 protein levels. In contrast, inhibition of DNA synthesis and increases in p53 protein did not occur after actinomycin D treatment of keratinocytes immortalized with HPV16 E6/E7 or in cervical carcinoma cell lines containing HPV16, HPV18, or mutant p53 alone. To test the effects of E6 alone on the cellular response to DNA damage, HPV16 E6 was expressed in the carcinoma cell line RKO, resulting in undetectable baseline levels of p53 protein and loss of the G1 arrest that normally occurs in these cells after DNA damage. These findings demonstrate that oncogenic E6 can disrupt an important cellular response to DNA damage mediated by p53 and may contribute to the subsequent accumulation of genetic changes associated with cervical tumorigenesis.},

abstract = {High-risk HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins cooperate to subvert critical host cell cycle checkpoint control mechanisms in order to promote viral genome replication. This results not only in aberrant proliferation but also in host cellular changes that can promote genomic instability. The HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein was found to induce centrosome abnormalities thereby disrupting mitotic fidelity and increasing the risk for chromosome missegregation and aneuploidy. In addition, expression of the high-risk HPV E7 oncoprotein stimulates DNA replication stress as a potential source of DNA breakage and structural chromosomal instability. Proliferation of genomically unstable cells is sustained by several mechanisms including the accelerated degradation of claspin by HPV-16 E7 and the degradation of p53 by the high-risk HPV E6 oncoprotein. These results highlight the oncogenic potential of aberrant proliferation and opens new avenues for prevention of malignant progression, not only in HPV-associated cervical cancer but also in non-virally associated malignancies with disrupted cell cycle checkpoint control mechanisms.},

abstract = {Loss of genomic integrity is a defining feature of many human malignancies, including human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated preinvasive and invasive genital squamous lesions. Here we show that aberrant mitotic spindle pole formation caused by abnormal centrosome numbers represents an important mechanism in accounting for numeric chromosomal alterations in HPV-associated carcinogenesis. Similar to what we found in histopathological specimens, HPV-16 E6 and E7 oncoproteins cooperate to induce abnormal centrosome numbers, aberrant mitotic spindle pole formation, and genomic instability. The low-risk HPV-6 E6 and E7 proteins did not induce such abnormalities. Whereas the HPV-16 E6 oncoprotein has no immediate effects on centrosome numbers, HPV-16 E7 rapidly induces abnormal centrosome duplication. Thus our results suggest a model whereby HPV-16 E7 induces centrosome-related mitotic disturbances that are potentiated by HPV-16 E6.},
