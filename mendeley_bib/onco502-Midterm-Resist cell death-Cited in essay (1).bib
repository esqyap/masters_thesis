abstract = {Cells that express the human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 E7 oncoprotein are predisposed to undergo apoptosis. Transgenic mice that have E7 expression targeted to either the retinal photoreceptor cells or the lens cells exhibit signs of apoptosis in cells attempting to undergo differentiation. We established a cell culture system to study this process and have determined the domains of E7 that are required for predisposing cells to undergo apoptosis in response to growth arrest signals. Regions within the core pRB binding site of E7 were necessary but not sufficient for inducing apoptosis. Residues within the adenovirus conserved region 1 homology domain and the consensus casein kinase II phosphorylation site are also important for this effect on cell viability. Our data also demonstrate that the ability of E7 to induce destabilization of pRB and stabilization of p53 coincides with E7-mediated transformation and apoptosis.},

abstract = {Oncogenic types of human papillomaviruses (HPVs) cause cervical cancer in humans. The antiapoptotic viral E6 gene has been identified as a key factor for maintaining the viability of HPV-positive cancer cells. Although E6 has the potential to modulate many apoptosis regulators, the crucial apoptotic pathway blocked by endogenous E6 in cervical cancer cells remained unknown. Using RNA interference (RNAi), here, we show that targeted inhibition of E6 expression in cervical cancer cells leads to the transcriptional stimulation of the PUMA promoter, in a p53-dependent manner. This is linked to the activation and translocation of Bax to the mitochondrial membrane, cytochrome c release into the cytosol, and activation of caspase-3, in a PUMA-dependent manner. Moreover, inhibition of Bax expression by RNAi efficiently reverts the apoptotic phenotype, which results from inhibition of E6 expression. Thus, interference with the p53/PUMA/Bax cascade is crucial for the antiapoptotic function of the viral E6 oncogene in HPV-positive cancer cells.},
annote = {1. Puma was increased transcriptionally upon E6 RNAi knockdown in Hela cells

2. Luciferase reporter assays - RNAi E6 inhibition led to increase PUMA promoter activitiy

3. Inhibition of p53 via RNAi abolished activation of PUMA promoter activity - p53 key mediator of PUMA expression

4. Deletion of major p53 response element resulted in abolished PUMA promoter activity 

5. Puma is a proapoptotic BH3-only protein that is upstream activator of Bax, by inducing conformational change and translocation from the cytosol to the mitochondrial membrane

6. E6 inhibition results in strong elevation of Bax at the mitochondria shown by cellular fractionation studies

7. Bax relocalization to the mitochondria was linked to increased cytochrome c in cytosol, activation of effector caspase-3 - similar to HeLa cells overexpressing PUMA or treated with apoptosis-inducing agent staurosporine

8. Above molecular events were PUMA-dependent as they were inhibited when HeLa cells were treated with E6 and PUMA RNAi

9. RNAi knockdown of both Bax and E6 in HeLa cells could prevent apoptosis (E6 knockdown, p53 increase, PUMA increase, Bax activated and accumulate at mito, apoptosis)

10. Bax knockdown alone did not affect colony formation capacity of HeLa cells

11. Bax important for cell death upon E6 inhibition},
