abstract = {The ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway plays a major role in selective protein degradation. Ubiquitination of proteins requires the sequential action of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2), and in some cases ubiquitin-protein ligases (E3s). The oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18 utilize this cellular proteolytic system to target the tumor suppressor protein p53. The HPV E6 oncoprotein binds to a cellular protein of 100 kd, termed E6-associated protein (E6-AP). The E6-E6-AP complex specifically interacts with p53, resulting in the rapid ubiquitin-dependent degradation of p53. Here we report the purification and identification of the factors necessary for the E6-E6-AP-mediated ubiquitination of p53. The ubiquitination of p53 requires the E1 enzyme and a novel E2 in mammalian cells, while E3 activity is conferred by the E6-E6-AP complex. Furthermore, E6-AP appears to have ubiquitin-protein ligase activity in the absence of E6.},

abstract = {Human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 proteins inhibit apoptosis in both p53-dependent and p53-independent manners. A key point in apoptosis is the regulation provided by the Bcl-2 family; and in differentiating keratinocytes, in which HPV replicates, the Bak protein is highly expressed. We show that HPV-18 E6 will inhibit Bak-induced apoptosis and this is mediated by an interaction between the E6 and Bak proteins resulting in degradation of the Bak protein in vivo. We also show that Bak protein interacts with the ubiquitin ligase, E6AP, and that a mutant of Bak defective in E6AP binding is overexpressed in comparison with wild type. These studies suggest that Bak is probably the first naturally occurring target of E6AP to be identified.},

@article{Magal2005b,
abstract = {Previous studies have shown that human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 E6 inhibits apoptosis induced during terminal differentiation of primary human keratinocytes (PHKs) triggered by serum and calcium. E6 inhibition of apoptosis was accompanied with prolonged expression of Bcl-2 and reduced elevation of Bax levels. In the present study, the effect of E6 on Bax mRNA expression and protein stability was investigated. These studies indicate that stable E6 expression in differentiating keratinocytes reduced the steady-state levels of Bax mRNA and shortened the half-life of Bax protein. These results were confirmed in transiently transfected 293T cells where E6 degraded Bax in a dose-dependent manner. Bax degradation was also exhibited in Saos-2 cells that lack p53, indicating its p53 independence. E6 did not form complexes with Bax and did not induce Bax degradation in vitro under experimental conditions where p53 was degraded. Finally, E6 aa 120-132 were shown to be necessary for Bax destabilization and, more importantly, for abrogating the ability of Bax to induce cellular apoptosis, highlighting the functional consequences of the E6-induced alterations in Bax expression.},

abstract = {Oncogenic types of human papillomaviruses (HPVs) cause cervical cancer in humans. The antiapoptotic viral E6 gene has been identified as a key factor for maintaining the viability of HPV-positive cancer cells. Although E6 has the potential to modulate many apoptosis regulators, the crucial apoptotic pathway blocked by endogenous E6 in cervical cancer cells remained unknown. Using RNA interference (RNAi), here, we show that targeted inhibition of E6 expression in cervical cancer cells leads to the transcriptional stimulation of the PUMA promoter, in a p53-dependent manner. This is linked to the activation and translocation of Bax to the mitochondrial membrane, cytochrome c release into the cytosol, and activation of caspase-3, in a PUMA-dependent manner. Moreover, inhibition of Bax expression by RNAi efficiently reverts the apoptotic phenotype, which results from inhibition of E6 expression. Thus, interference with the p53/PUMA/Bax cascade is crucial for the antiapoptotic function of the viral E6 oncogene in HPV-positive cancer cells.},
annote = {1. Puma was increased transcriptionally upon E6 RNAi knockdown in Hela cells

2. Luciferase reporter assays - RNAi E6 inhibition led to increase PUMA promoter activitiy

3. Inhibition of p53 via RNAi abolished activation of PUMA promoter activity - p53 key mediator of PUMA expression

4. Deletion of major p53 response element resulted in abolished PUMA promoter activity 

5. Puma is a proapoptotic BH3-only protein that is upstream activator of Bax, by inducing conformational change and translocation from the cytosol to the mitochondrial membrane

6. E6 inhibition results in strong elevation of Bax at the mitochondria shown by cellular fractionation studies

7. Bax relocalization to the mitochondria was linked to increased cytochrome c in cytosol, activation of effector caspase-3 - similar to HeLa cells overexpressing PUMA or treated with apoptosis-inducing agent staurosporine

8. Above molecular events were PUMA-dependent as they were inhibited when HeLa cells were treated with E6 and PUMA RNAi

9. RNAi knockdown of both Bax and E6 in HeLa cells could prevent apoptosis (E6 knockdown, p53 increase, PUMA increase, Bax activated and accumulate at mito, apoptosis)

10. Bax knockdown alone did not affect colony formation capacity of HeLa cells

11. Bax important for cell death upon E6 inhibition},

abstract = {Cells that express the human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 E7 oncoprotein are predisposed to undergo apoptosis. Transgenic mice that have E7 expression targeted to either the retinal photoreceptor cells or the lens cells exhibit signs of apoptosis in cells attempting to undergo differentiation. We established a cell culture system to study this process and have determined the domains of E7 that are required for predisposing cells to undergo apoptosis in response to growth arrest signals. Regions within the core pRB binding site of E7 were necessary but not sufficient for inducing apoptosis. Residues within the adenovirus conserved region 1 homology domain and the consensus casein kinase II phosphorylation site are also important for this effect on cell viability. Our data also demonstrate that the ability of E7 to induce destabilization of pRB and stabilization of p53 coincides with E7-mediated transformation and apoptosis.},

@article{Underbrink2008b,
abstract = {Human papillomavirus (HPV) types from the beta genus (beta-HPVs) have been implicated in the development of skin cancer. A potentially important aspect of their carcinogenic role is the ability of the E6 protein to degrade the proapoptotic family member Bak, which gives cells the ability to survive UV damage. However, it is unknown if the ability to degrade Bak is limited to certain beta-HPV types or whether E6 expression in keratinocytes affects other proteins important for apoptosis signaling. We tested the abilities of E6 proteins from several representative members of the beta-HPVs to degrade Bak and protect UV-treated keratinocytes from apoptosis. The E6 proteins of the beta-HPV type 5 (HPV5), -8, -20, -22, -38, -76, -92, and -96, as well as the alpha genus HPV HPV16, all degraded Bak or prevented its accumulation following UV treatment but did not degrade Bak constitutively. In addition, when tested using HPV16 E6 (16E6) and 8E6 as representative E6 proteins from the alpha and beta genera, respectively, Bak degradation was dependent on the E3 ubiquitin ligase, E6AP. Other important regulators of apoptotic signaling were examined and found to be unperturbed by the expression of the beta-HPV E6 proteins. Importantly, the expression of beta-HPV E6 proteins protected keratinocytes from apoptosis to the same extent as 16E6-expressing cells. In conclusion, several of the beta-HPV types possess the ability to protect UV-treated keratinocytes from apoptosis by reducing levels of Bak in those cells, thus blocking the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.},

abstract = {Human papillomavirus (HPV) replication occurs in terminally differentiating epithelium, and requires the activation of cellular DNA replication proteins. Unscheduled DNA replication can result in the induction of apoptosis, and the viral E6 protein induces the degradation of p53 to prevent this. It has recently been shown that HPV-18 E6 can also stimulate the degradation of Bak, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family. This report shows that the E6 proteins from HPV-18, HPV-16 and HPV-11 can all bind to Bak in vitro, stimulate its degradation in vivo and reduce Bak-induced apoptosis. However, the non-oncogenic HPV-11 E6 is less effective than the oncogenic E6 proteins in each of these assays, indicating that the ability of HPV to circumvent the apoptosis induced by Bak may contribute to the oncogenic potential of the virus.},
