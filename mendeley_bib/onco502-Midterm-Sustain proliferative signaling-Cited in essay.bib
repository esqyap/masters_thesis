abstract = {To investigate E7-dependent biochemical changes which are involved in cellular transformation, we analyzed the influence of human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) E7 on the expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins. Expression of E7 in established rodent fibroblasts (NIH 3T3), which was shown to be sufficient for transformation of these cells, leads to constitutive expression of the cyclin E and cyclin A genes in the absence of external growth factors. Surprisingly, expression of the cyclin D1 gene, which encodes a major regulator of G1 progression, is unaltered in E7-transformed cells. In transient transfection experiments, the cyclin A gene promoter is activated by E7 via an E2F binding site. In 14/2 cells, which were used as a model system to analyze the role of HPV-16 E7 in the transformation of primary cells, we observed rapid E7-dependent activation of cyclin E gene expression, which can be uncoupled from activation of the cyclin A gene, since the latter requires additional protein synthesis. E7-driven induction of cyclin E and cyclin A gene expression was accompanied by an increase in the associated kinase activities. Two domains of the E7 oncoprotein, which are designated cd1 and cd2, are essential for transformation of rodent fibroblasts. It is shown here that growth factor-independent expression of the cyclin E gene requires cd2 but not cd1, while activation of cyclin A gene expression requires cd1 function in addition to that of cd2. These data suggest that cyclin A gene expression is controlled by two distinct negative signals, one of which also restricts expression of the cyclin E gene. The ability of E7 to separately override each of these inhibitory signals, via cd1 and cd2, cosegregates with its ability to fully transform rodent fibroblasts. Unlike serum growth factors, E7 induces S-phase entry without activating cyclin D1 gene expression, in keeping with the finding that cyclin D1 function is not required in cells transformed by DNA tumor viruses.},
annote = {1. Serum starvation led to G1 arrest in control cells

2. E7 transfected cell can still enter S-phase upon serum starvation - flow cytometry analysis

3. Upon serum starvation, e7 transfected cells continued to incorporate [3H]thymidine - DNA synthesis still goes on

4. Upon serum starvation, mRNA of cylin E and A were only slightly decreased in E7-expressing cells in contrast to control cells.
Western blot analysis: cyclin A not reduced in E7 expressing cells, no change in cyclin E

5. Human cyclin A promoter - firefly luciferase plasmid transfected into E7-expressing NIH 3T3 - under growth factor limiting conditions, deletion mutants were analyzed (E2F binding site located at -32/+11)
-promoter mutant without E2F binding site results in 50{\%} decreased in cyclin A promoter responsiveness},

abstract = {Cdc25A is a tyrosine phosphatase that is involved in the regulation of the G1/S phase transition by activating cyclin E/Cdk2 and cyclin A/Cdk2 complexes through removal of inhibitory phosphorylations. The E6 and E7 oncoproteins of the high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV) interact with and functionally abrogate the p53 and pRB proteins, respectively. In the present study we have investigated the regulation of the Cdc25A promoter during G1 and S-phases of the cell cycle and by the HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein. Serum induction leads to a derepression of the Cdc25A promoter and can be mediated through two E2F binding sites, E2F-A and E2F-C. While E2F-A is by both E2F1 and E2F4, E2F-C is regulated only by E2F1. The Cdc25A promoter is transactivated by the E7 oncogene of HPV-16. Furthermore, Cdc25A levels are highly increased in E7-expressing cell lines. Inducible expression of E7 leads to an immediate increase in Cdc25A protein levels. These data suggest that Cdc25A may be a critical target of HPV-16 E7 in the disruption of the G1/S phase transition.},

abstract = {The E7 proteins encoded by the human papillomaviruses (HPVs) associated with anogenital lesions share significant amino acid sequence homology. The E7 proteins of these different HPVs were assessed for their ability to form complexes with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene product (p105-RB). Similar to the E7 protein of HPV-16, the E7 proteins of HPV-18, HBV-6b and HPV-11 were found to associate with p105-RB in vitro. The E7 proteins of HPV types associated with a high risk of malignant progression (HPV-16 and HPV-18) formed complexes with p105-RB with equal affinities. The E7 proteins encoded by HPV types 6b and 11, which are associated with clinical lesions with a lower risk for progression, bound to p105-RB with lower affinities. The E7 protein of the bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1), which does not share structural similarity in the amino terminal region with the HPV E7 proteins, was unable to form a detectable complex with p105-RB. The amino acid sequences of the HPV-16 E7 protein involved in complex formation with p105-RB in vitro have been mapped. Only a portion of the sequences that are conserved between the HPV E7 proteins and AdE1A were necessary for association with p105-RB. Furthermore, the HPV-16 E7-p105-RB complex was detected in an HPV-16-transformed human keratinocyte cell line.},

abstract = {The adenovirus E1A gene product, the simian virus 40 large tumor antigen, and the human papillomavirus E7 protein share a short amino acid sequence that constitutes a domain required for the transforming activity of these proteins. These sequences are also required for these proteins to bind to the retinoblastoma gene product (pRb). Recent experiments have shown that E1A can dissociate complexes containing the transcription factor E2F bound to pRb, dependent on this conserved sequence element. We now show that the E7 protein and the simian virus 40 large tumor antigen can dissociate the E2F-pRb complex, dependent on this conserved sequence element. We also find that the E2F-pRb complex is absent in various human cervical carcinoma cell lines that either express the E7 protein or harbor an RB1 mutation, suggesting that the loss of the E2F-pRb interaction may be an important aspect in human cervical carcinogenesis. We suggest that the ability of E1A, the simian virus 40 large tumor antigen, and E7 to dissociate the E2F-pRb complex may be a common activity of these viral proteins that has evolved to stimulate quiescent cells into a proliferating state so that viral replication can proceed efficiently. In circumstances in which a lytic infection does not proceed, the consequence of this action may be to initiate the oncogenic process in a manner analogous to the mutation of the RB1 gene.},
