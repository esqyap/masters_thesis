abstract = {MicroRNAs are non-coding RNAs with important functions in several biological processes, such as, regulation of cell cycle, immune response, inflammation, and apoptosis. In fact, deregulation and abnormal expression of these molecules is associated with human pathologies including cancer and several have already emerged as potential prognostic biomarkers in different neoplasias. miR-34a is directly regulated by p53 and acts as tumor suppressor while miR-125b plays a significant role in immune response and apoptosis. In cervical carcinogenesis, HPV proteins seem to interact with both miR-34a and miR-125b changing its expression and promoting persistent infection and cervical cancer development. In this review we describe the potential role of miR-125b and miR-34a in cervical carcinogenesis, including interaction with HPV and mechanism of deregulation. Additionally, their clinical applications in cervical cancer as prognostic/predictive biomarkers are also briefly discussed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The subpopulations and functions of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) from cervical cancer (CC) are altered. Dysfunction of TIL could be partially because of the inhibition by regulatory T (T(reg)) cells. FOXP3 is the control gene for the T(reg) cells.

METHODS: We investigated the distribution of TILs and FOXP3(+) cells in CC (n = 10) and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (n = 8) tissues. Double-immunofluorescence and confocal-based image quantitative microscopic analysis were used to calculate the number of cluster of differentiation (CD)4(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(+) T(reg) cells around the tumor cells.

RESULTS: The CD4(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(+) phenotype of T(reg) cells was accumulated around the tumor cells. CC contains a significantly higher proportion of the FOXP3(+) T cells than in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (p {\textless} 0.001). Moreover, CC with lymph node metastasis has a higher proportion of the FOXP3(+) T cells than that without lymph node metastasis (p {\textless} 0.05).

CONCLUSION: The increased accumulation of T(reg) cells suggests that T(reg) cells are important in the immunopathogenesis of CC.},

abstract = {The networks of blood and lymphatic vessels and of the extracellular matrix and their cellular and structural components, that are collectively termed the tumor microenvironment, are frequently co-opted and shaped by cancer cells to survive, invade, and form distant metastasis. With an enviable capacity to adapt to continually changing environments, cancer represents the epitome of functional chaos, a stark contrast to the hierarchical and organized differentiation processes that dictate the development and life of biological organisms. The consequences of changing landscapes such as hypoxia and acidic extracellular pH in and around tumors create a cascade of changes in multiple pathways and networks that become apparent only several years later as recurrence and metastasis. These molecular and phenotypic changes, several of which are mediated by COX-2, approach the complexities of a "Gordian Knot." We review evidence from our studies and from literature suggesting that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) biology presents a nodal point in cancer biology and an "Achilles heel" of COX-2-dependent tumors.},

abstract = {Human papillomavirus (HPV) 16/18 E6 oncoprotein is expressed in lung tumors and is associated with p53 inactivation. The tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP-3) is essential for limiting inflammation; therefore, we expected that TIMP-3 loss might induce chronic inflammation, thereby promoting tumor malignancy as well as poor survival and relapse in patients with HPV-infected non-small cell lung cancer. In this study, the loss of TIMP-3 by loss of heterozygosity and/or promoter hypermethylation was more frequent in HPV16/18 E6-positive tumors than in E6-negative tumors. To explore the possible underlying mechanism, E6-negative TL4 and CL1-0 cells were transfected with an E6 cDNA plasmid. A marked decrease in TIMP-3 expression was caused by promoter hypermethylation via increased DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) expression. Mechanistic studies indicated that TIMP-3 loss promoted interleukin-6 (IL-6) production, which led to cell invasion and anchorage-independent growth on soft agar plates. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression models showed that patients with low-TIMP-3/high-IL-6 tumors had shorter overall survival and relapse-free survival periods when compared with patients with high-TIMP-3/low-IL-6 tumors. In summary, loss of TIMP-3 may increase IL-6 production via the tumor necrosis factor $\alpha$/nuclear factor $\kappa$B axis, thereby promoting tumor malignancy and subsequent relapse and poor survival in patients with HPV-infected non-small cell lung cancer.},

abstract = {Chronic inflammation predisposes tissue to cancer development; however, regulatory mechanisms underlying recruitment of innate leukocytes toward developing neoplasms are obscure. We report that genetic elimination of mature T and B lymphocytes in a transgenic mouse model of inflammation-associated de novo epithelial carcinogenesis, e.g., K14-HPV16 mice, limits neoplastic progression to development of epithelial hyperplasias that fail to recruit innate immune cells. Adoptive transfer of B lymphocytes or serum from HPV16 mice into T and B cell-deficient/HPV16 mice restores innate immune cell infiltration into premalignant tissue and reinstates necessary parameters for full malignancy, e.g., chronic inflammation, angiogenic vasculature, hyperproliferative epidermis. These findings support a model in which B lymphocytes are required for establishing chronic inflammatory states that promote de novo carcinogenesis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest a potential impact of Th17 cells on tumor. In the present study, we investigated the distribution of Th17 cells in relation to Foxp3-expressing T cells in the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) from patients with uterine cervical cancer (UCC), cervical tissues from patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and healthy cervical tissues.

METHODS: Th17 cells and Foxp3-expressing T cells were evaluated by immunohistochemical staining. IL-6, TGF-$\beta$, IL-17 and IL-10 were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Immunohistochemical staining for microvessel density (MVD) was performed in order to assess the association of IL-17 expression with angiogenesis.

RESULTS: Compared with controls, patients with UCC or CIN had a higher proportion of Th17 cells and Foxp3-expressing T cells, when the ratio of Th17/Foxp3-expressing T cells in TILs was decreased in individual cases, it was more markedly decreased in TILs than normal cervical tissues. Meanwhile, the cytokine(IL-6, TGF-$\beta$ and IL-10) concentrations were significantly higher in UCC patients than those in healthy controls. Interestingly, the levels of intratumoral Th17 cells were positively correlated with MVD in tumors.

CONCLUSIONS: The imbalance of Th17/Foxp3-expressing T cells may play critical roles in the development and progression of UCC and Th17 cells may promote tumor progression by fostering angiogenesis.},

abstract = {Several recent studies have identified nuclear factor-kappaB as a key modulator in driving inflammation to cancers. Besides this transcription factor, essential in regulating inflammation and cancer development, an inflammatory microenvironment inhabiting various inflammatory cells and a network of signaling molecules are also indispensable for the malignant progression of transformed cells, which is attributed to the mutagenic predisposition of persistent infection-fighting agents at sites of chronic inflammation. As a subverted host response to inflammation-induced tumors, the inflammatory cells and regulators may facilitate angiogenesis and promote the growth, invasion, and metastasis of tumor cells. Thus far, research regarding inflammation-associated cancer development has focused on cytokines and chemokines as well as their downstream targets in linking inflammation and cancer. Moreover, other proteins with extensive roles in inflammation and cancer, such as signal transducers and activators of transcription, Nrf2, and nuclear factor of activated T cells, are also proposed to be promising targets for future studies. The elucidation of their specific effects and interactions will accelerate the development of novel therapeutic interventions against cancer development triggered by inflammation.},

abstract = {Cyclooxygenase (COX-2) is overexpressed in human papillomavirus (HPV)-induced diseases, including cervical cancer. Although HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins have been causally linked to cervical carcinogenesis, their effects on COX-2 gene expression are unknown. Increased levels of COX-2 mRNA, protein, and prostaglandin E(2) synthesis were detected in HPV16 E6- and E7-expressing cervical cancer cells (CaSki and SiHa) compared with an uninfected cervical cancer cell line (C33A). HPV16 E6 and E7 oncoproteins induced COX-2 transcription by activating the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)--{\textgreater}Ras--{\textgreater}mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Interestingly, HPV16 oncoproteins stimulated EGFR signaling, in part, by inducing the release of amphiregulin, an EGFR ligand. The inductive effects of HPV16 E6 and E7 were mediated by enhanced binding of activator protein-1 to the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-responsive element (-59/-53) of the COX-2 promoter. The potential contribution of coactivators and corepressors to HPV16 E6- and E7-mediated induction of COX-2 was also investigated. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that E6 and E7 oncoproteins induced the recruitment of phosphorylated c-Jun, c-Fos, UbcH5, and cAMP-responsive element binding protein-binding protein/p300 to the COX-2 promoter. In contrast, E6 and E7 inhibited the binding of the histone deacetylase 3-nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR) complex to the COX-2 promoter. Moreover, overexpression of NCoR blocked E6- and E7-mediated stimulation of the COX-2 promoter. Taken together, these results indicate that HPV16 E6 and E7 oncoproteins stimulated COX-2 transcription by inducing a corepressor/coactivator exchange. To our knowledge, this study also provides the first evidence that NCoR can function as a repressor of COX-2 gene expression.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the role of immunological parameters in tumorigenesis of cervical cancer in women infected with high risk human papillomavirus (hr-HPV), and determine whether key findings with human material can be recapitulated in the mouse TC1 carcinoma model which expresses hr-HPV epitopes.

METHODS: Epithelial and lymphoid cells in cervical tissues were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and serum IL10 levels were determined by ELISA. Tumor draining lymph nodes were analyzed in the mouse TC1 model by flow cytometry.

RESULTS: The mucosa was infiltrated by CD20+ and CD138+ cells already at cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 1 (CIN1) and infiltration increased in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3 (CIN3)/carcinoma in situ (CIS) and invasive cervical cancer (ICC), where it strongly correlated with infiltration by CD32B+ and FoxP3+ lymphocytes. GATA3+ and T-bet+ lymphoid cells were increased in ICC compared to normal, and expression in epithelial cells of the Th2 inflammation-promoting cytokine TSLP and of IDO1 was higher in CIN3/CIS and ICC. As a corollary, serum levels of IL10 were higher in women with CIN3/CIS or ICC than in normals. Finally we demonstrated in the mouse TC1 carcinoma, which expresses hr-HPV epitopes, an increase of cells expressing B cell or plasma cell markers or Fc receptors in tumor-draining than distal lymph nodes or spleen.

CONCLUSIONS: hr-HPV initiates a local Th2 inflammation at an early stage, involving antibody forming cells, and fosters an immunosuppressive microenvironment that aids tumor progression.},

Levels of IFN-$\gamma$, TNF-$\alpha$, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12, TGF-$\beta$1 and TGF-$\beta$2 were then assayed by RT-PCR and ELISA for each biopsy sample. For LSILs, higher levels of Th1 cytokines were detected, while HSILs were associated with a Th2 cytokine profile. In contrast, CA tissues were associated with the strongest expression of a Treg cytokine profile. In conclusion the most important contribution of these work is identification of the Treg cytokine profile in HPV progression lesions and in combination, these results suggested that tumor progression is dependent on suppression of cellular immunity.},

Avoiding the immune response has been considered a key aspect of HPV persistence which is the main factor leading to HPV-related neoplasia. HPVs have evolved different ways of targeting immune signaling pathways.
