abstract = {HPVs (human papillomaviruses) infect epithelial cells and cause a variety of lesions ranging from common warts/verrucas to cervical neoplasia and cancer. Over 100 different HPV types have been identified so far, with a subset of these being classified as high risk. High-risk HPV DNA is found in almost all cervical cancers ({\textgreater}99.7{\%}), with HPV16 being the most prevalent type in both low-grade disease and cervical neoplasia. Productive infection by high-risk HPV types is manifest as cervical flat warts or condyloma that shed infectious virions from their surface. Viral genomes are maintained as episomes in the basal layer, with viral gene expression being tightly controlled as the infected cells move towards the epithelial surface. The pattern of viral gene expression in low-grade cervical lesions resembles that seen in productive warts caused by other HPV types. High-grade neoplasia represents an abortive infection in which viral gene expression becomes deregulated, and the normal life cycle of the virus cannot be completed. Most cervical cancers arise within the cervical transformation zone at the squamous/columnar junction, and it has been suggested that this is a site where productive infection may be inefficiently supported. The high-risk E6 and E7 proteins drive cell proliferation through their association with PDZ domain proteins and Rb (retinoblastoma), and contribute to neoplastic progression, whereas E6-mediated p53 degradation prevents the normal repair of chance mutations in the cellular genome. Cancers usually arise in individuals who fail to resolve their infection and who retain oncogene expression for years or decades. In most individuals, immune regression eventually leads to clearance of the virus, or to its maintenance in a latent or asymptomatic state in the basal cells.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the role of immunological parameters in tumorigenesis of cervical cancer in women infected with high risk human papillomavirus (hr-HPV), and determine whether key findings with human material can be recapitulated in the mouse TC1 carcinoma model which expresses hr-HPV epitopes.

METHODS: Epithelial and lymphoid cells in cervical tissues were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and serum IL10 levels were determined by ELISA. Tumor draining lymph nodes were analyzed in the mouse TC1 model by flow cytometry.

RESULTS: The mucosa was infiltrated by CD20+ and CD138+ cells already at cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 1 (CIN1) and infiltration increased in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3 (CIN3)/carcinoma in situ (CIS) and invasive cervical cancer (ICC), where it strongly correlated with infiltration by CD32B+ and FoxP3+ lymphocytes. GATA3+ and T-bet+ lymphoid cells were increased in ICC compared to normal, and expression in epithelial cells of the Th2 inflammation-promoting cytokine TSLP and of IDO1 was higher in CIN3/CIS and ICC. As a corollary, serum levels of IL10 were higher in women with CIN3/CIS or ICC than in normals. Finally we demonstrated in the mouse TC1 carcinoma, which expresses hr-HPV epitopes, an increase of cells expressing B cell or plasma cell markers or Fc receptors in tumor-draining than distal lymph nodes or spleen.

CONCLUSIONS: hr-HPV initiates a local Th2 inflammation at an early stage, involving antibody forming cells, and fosters an immunosuppressive microenvironment that aids tumor progression.},

abstract = {Accurate DNA replication and repair is essential for proper development, growth and tumor-free survival in all multicellular organisms. A key requirement for the maintenance of genomic integrity is the availability of adequate and balanced pools of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), the building blocks of DNA. Notably, dNTP pool alterations lead to genomic instability and have been linked to multiple human diseases, including mitochondrial disorders, susceptibility to viral infection and cancer. In this review, we discuss how a key regulator of dNTP biosynthesis in mammals, the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), impacts cancer susceptibility and serves as a target for anti-cancer therapies. Because RNR-regulated dNTP production can influence DNA replication fidelity while also supporting genome-protecting DNA repair, RNR has complex and stage-specific roles in carcinogenesis. Nevertheless, cancer cells are dependent on RNR for de novo dNTP biosynthesis. Therefore, elevated RNR expression is a characteristic of many cancers, and an array of mechanistically distinct RNR inhibitors serve as effective agents for cancer treatment. The dNTP metabolism machinery, including RNR, has been exploited for therapeutic benefit for decades and remains an important target for cancer drug development.Oncogene advance online publication, 9 June 2014; doi:10.1038/onc.2014.155.},

abstract = {Infection with certain types of human papillomaviruses (HPV) is highly associated with carcinomas of the human uterine cervix. However, HPV infection alone does not appear to be sufficient for the process of malignant transformation, suggesting the requirement of additional cellular events. After DNA damage, normal mammalian cells exhibit G1 cell-cycle arrest and inhibition of replicative DNA synthesis. This mechanism, which requires wild-type p53, presumably allows cells to undertake DNA repair and avoid the fixation of mutations. We directly tested whether the normal response of cervical epithelial cells to DNA damage may be undermined by interactions between the E6 protein expressed by oncogenic HPV types and wild-type p53. We treated primary keratinocytes with the DNA-damaging agent actinomycin D and demonstrated inhibition of replicative DNA synthesis and a significant increase in p53 protein levels. In contrast, inhibition of DNA synthesis and increases in p53 protein did not occur after actinomycin D treatment of keratinocytes immortalized with HPV16 E6/E7 or in cervical carcinoma cell lines containing HPV16, HPV18, or mutant p53 alone. To test the effects of E6 alone on the cellular response to DNA damage, HPV16 E6 was expressed in the carcinoma cell line RKO, resulting in undetectable baseline levels of p53 protein and loss of the G1 arrest that normally occurs in these cells after DNA damage. These findings demonstrate that oncogenic E6 can disrupt an important cellular response to DNA damage mediated by p53 and may contribute to the subsequent accumulation of genetic changes associated with cervical tumorigenesis.},

abstract = {Human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 proteins inhibit apoptosis in both p53-dependent and p53-independent manners. A key point in apoptosis is the regulation provided by the Bcl-2 family; and in differentiating keratinocytes, in which HPV replicates, the Bak protein is highly expressed. We show that HPV-18 E6 will inhibit Bak-induced apoptosis and this is mediated by an interaction between the E6 and Bak proteins resulting in degradation of the Bak protein in vivo. We also show that Bak protein interacts with the ubiquitin ligase, E6AP, and that a mutant of Bak defective in E6AP binding is overexpressed in comparison with wild type. These studies suggest that Bak is probably the first naturally occurring target of E6AP to be identified.},

abstract = {The E7 oncoprotein of the high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV) is thought to contribute to cervical carcinogenesis at least in part by abrogating cell cycle regulation. E7 can dysregulate the cell cycle through its interaction with several cellular proteins including the retinoblastoma suppressor protein pRb, as well as the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(Cip1). Inactivation of pRb in cervical epithelia is not sufficient to explain the ability of E7 to cause cervical cancers in transgenic mice. In the current study, we focused on the role of p21(Cip1) in cervical cancer. Cervical disease was significantly increased in p21(-/-) mice compared with p21(+/+) mice, showing that p21(Cip1) can function as a tumor suppressor in this tissue. Importantly, the ability of E7 to induce cervical cancers was not significantly enhanced on the p21-null background, consistent with the hypothesis that the ability of E7 to inhibit p21(Cip1) contributes to its carcinogenic properties. Further supportive of this hypothesis, cervical carcinogenesis in mice expressing a mutant form of HPV-16 E7, E7(CVQ), which fails to inactivate p21(Cip1), was significantly reduced compared with that in K14E7(WT) mice expressing wild-type HPV-16 E7. However, K14E7(CVQ) mice still displayed heightened levels of cervical carcinogenesis compared with that in nontransgenic mice, indicating that activities of E7 besides its capacity to inactivate p21(Cip1) also contribute to cervical carcinogenesis. Taken together, we conclude that p21(Cip1) functions as a tumor suppressor in cervical carcinogenesis and that p21(Cip1) inactivation by HPV-16 E7 partially contributes to the contribution of E7 to cervical carcinogenesis.},

Ubiquitination of proteins requires the sequential action of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2), and in some cases ubiquitin-protein ligases (E3s). The oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18 utilize this cellular proteolytic system to target the tumor suppressor protein p53. The HPV E6 oncoprotein binds to a cellular protein of 100 kd, termed E6-associated protein (E6-AP). The E6-E6-AP complex specifically interacts with p53, resulting in the rapid ubiquitin-dependent degradation of p53. Here we report the purification and identification of the factors necessary for the E6-E6-AP-mediated ubiquitination of p53. The ubiquitination of p53 requires the E1 enzyme and a novel E2 in mammalian cells, while E3 activity is conferred by the E6-E6-AP complex. Furthermore, E6-AP appears to have ubiquitin-protein ligase activity in the absence of E6.},

abstract = {Myriad genetic and epigenetic alterations are required to drive normal cells toward malignant transformation. These somatic events commandeer many signaling pathways that cooperate to endow aspiring cancer cells with a full range of biological capabilities needed to grow, disseminate and ultimately kill its host. Cancer genomes are highly rearranged and are characterized by complex translocations and regional copy number alterations that target loci harboring cancer-relevant genes. Efforts to uncover the underlying mechanisms driving genome instability in cancer have revealed a prominent role for telomeres. Telomeres are nucleoprotein structures that protect the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes and are particularly vulnerable due to progressive shortening during each round of DNA replication and, thus, a lifetime of tissue renewal places the organism at risk for increasing chromosomal instability. Indeed, telomere erosion has been documented in aging tissues and hyperproliferative disease states-conditions strongly associated with increased cancer risk. Telomere dysfunction can produce the opposing pathophysiological states of degenerative aging or cancer with the specific outcome dictated by the integrity of DNA damage checkpoint responses. In most advanced cancers, telomerase is reactivated and serves to maintain telomere length and emerging data have also documented the capacity of telomerase to directly regulate cancer-promoting pathways. This review covers the role of telomeres and telomerase in the biology of normal tissue stem/progenitor cells and in the development of cancer.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to confirm that RRM2 as a novel target of HPVE7 involved in cervical cancer angiogenesis.

METHODS: Gene expression was analysed by RT-qPCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry in cervical cancer tissue and cell lines. Luciferase reporter assay was used to determine the activities of various RRM2 promoters. Secreted VEGF was measured by ELISA. RRM2-mediated capillary tube formation induced by HPVE7 in cervical cancer cells were evaluated using human umbilical vein endothelial cells in vitro. ROS induced by RRM2 in cercal cancer cells was confirmed by flow cytometry. The growth of cervical cancer cell overexpression RRM2 was examined by nude mouse xenograft.

RESULTS: RRM2 as a novel downstream target for HPVE7 was upregulated by it at the transcriptional level through the E7-pRb interaction and binding of E2F to the RRM2 promoter region. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the level of RRM2 positively correlated with the HPVE7 level in human cervical cancer. Functionally, overexpression of RRM2 enhanced the expression of HIF-1$\alpha$ and VEGF via activation of the ERK1/2 signalling pathway in cervical cancer cells, and significantly associated with increased microvessel densities in cervical cancer tissues. In vitro, HPVE7 stimulated RRM2-dependent capillary tube formation by HUVECs, and RRM2-enhanced angiogenesis was VEGF dependent. RRM2-activated ERK1/2 pathway was mediated through production of ROS. In the xenograft mouse model, overexpression of RRM2 in cervical cancer cells enhanced tumour growth as well as microvessel densities.

CONCLUSION: HPVE7 induces upregulation of RRM2, which then promotes cervical carcinogenesis via ROS-ERK1/2-HIF-1$\alpha$-VEGF-induced angiogenesis. Thus, the inhibition of RRM2 activity may be a novel therapeutic strategy for human cervical cancer.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest a potential impact of Th17 cells on tumor. In the present study, we investigated the distribution of Th17 cells in relation to Foxp3-expressing T cells in the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) from patients with uterine cervical cancer (UCC), cervical tissues from patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and healthy cervical tissues.

METHODS: Th17 cells and Foxp3-expressing T cells were evaluated by immunohistochemical staining. IL-6, TGF-$\beta$, IL-17 and IL-10 were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Immunohistochemical staining for microvessel density (MVD) was performed in order to assess the association of IL-17 expression with angiogenesis.

RESULTS: Compared with controls, patients with UCC or CIN had a higher proportion of Th17 cells and Foxp3-expressing T cells, when the ratio of Th17/Foxp3-expressing T cells in TILs was decreased in individual cases, it was more markedly decreased in TILs than normal cervical tissues. Meanwhile, the cytokine(IL-6, TGF-$\beta$ and IL-10) concentrations were significantly higher in UCC patients than those in healthy controls. Interestingly, the levels of intratumoral Th17 cells were positively correlated with MVD in tumors.

CONCLUSIONS: The imbalance of Th17/Foxp3-expressing T cells may play critical roles in the development and progression of UCC and Th17 cells may promote tumor progression by fostering angiogenesis.},

abstract = {Loss of genomic integrity is a defining feature of many human malignancies, including human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated preinvasive and invasive genital squamous lesions. Here we show that aberrant mitotic spindle pole formation caused by abnormal centrosome numbers represents an important mechanism in accounting for numeric chromosomal alterations in HPV-associated carcinogenesis. Similar to what we found in histopathological specimens, HPV-16 E6 and E7 oncoproteins cooperate to induce abnormal centrosome numbers, aberrant mitotic spindle pole formation, and genomic instability. The low-risk HPV-6 E6 and E7 proteins did not induce such abnormalities. Whereas the HPV-16 E6 oncoprotein has no immediate effects on centrosome numbers, HPV-16 E7 rapidly induces abnormal centrosome duplication. Thus our results suggest a model whereby HPV-16 E7 induces centrosome-related mitotic disturbances that are potentiated by HPV-16 E6.},

abstract = {Human papillomavirus (HPV) 16/18 E6 oncoprotein is expressed in lung tumors and is associated with p53 inactivation. The tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP-3) is essential for limiting inflammation; therefore, we expected that TIMP-3 loss might induce chronic inflammation, thereby promoting tumor malignancy as well as poor survival and relapse in patients with HPV-infected non-small cell lung cancer. In this study, the loss of TIMP-3 by loss of heterozygosity and/or promoter hypermethylation was more frequent in HPV16/18 E6-positive tumors than in E6-negative tumors. To explore the possible underlying mechanism, E6-negative TL4 and CL1-0 cells were transfected with an E6 cDNA plasmid. A marked decrease in TIMP-3 expression was caused by promoter hypermethylation via increased DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) expression. Mechanistic studies indicated that TIMP-3 loss promoted interleukin-6 (IL-6) production, which led to cell invasion and anchorage-independent growth on soft agar plates. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression models showed that patients with low-TIMP-3/high-IL-6 tumors had shorter overall survival and relapse-free survival periods when compared with patients with high-TIMP-3/low-IL-6 tumors. In summary, loss of TIMP-3 may increase IL-6 production via the tumor necrosis factor $\alpha$/nuclear factor $\kappa$B axis, thereby promoting tumor malignancy and subsequent relapse and poor survival in patients with HPV-infected non-small cell lung cancer.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Infection with high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) such as HPV-16 is intimately associated with squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) of the anogenital tract and a subset of oropharyngeal carcinomas. Such lesions, including pre-invasive precursors, frequently show multipolar mitoses and aneuploidy. The high-risk HPV-16-encoded E7 oncoprotein has been shown to rapidly induce centrosome abnormalities thereby causing the formation of supernumerary mitotic spindle poles and increasing the risk for chromosome missegregation. HPV-16 E7 has been found to rapidly induce centriole overduplication, in part, through the simultaneous formation of more than one daughter centriole at single maternal centrioles (centriole multiplication). The precise molecular mechanism that underlies HPV-16 E7-induced centriole multiplication, however, remains poorly understood.

FINDINGS: Here, we show that human keratinocytes engineered to stably express the HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein exhibit aberrant Polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4) protein expression at maternal centrioles. Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase (qRT-PCR) analysis of these cells revealed an increase of PLK4 mRNA levels compared to control cells. Importantly, the ability of the HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein to induce centriole multiplication was found to correlate with its ability to activate the PLK4 promoter and to up-regulate PLK4 mRNA.

CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the critical role of PLK4 transcriptional deregulation in centriole multiplication in HPV-16 E7-expressing cells. Our findings encourage further experiments to test transcriptional inhibitors or small molecules targeting PLK4 to prevent centriole abnormalities, mitotic infidelity and malignant progression in HPV-associated neoplasms and other tumors in which PLK4 regulation is disrupted.},

abstract = {Human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 is involved in causing cervical cancer. The E6 and E7 proteins of HPV 16 immortalize human keratinocytes and this is due, at least in part, to inactivation of the tumor suppressor proteins p53 and pRB. These tumor suppressor proteins also regulate the expression of pro- and antiangiogenic factors by cells. For this reason, experiments were conducted to determine whether the expression of E6 and E7 in primary keratinocytes alters the phenotype of these cells such that they express diminished levels of antiangiogenic factors and/or increased levels of proangiogenic factors. To avoid variances in experimental observations, pools of human foreskin keratinocytes from multiple sources were infected with recombinant retrovirus expressing HPV 16 E6 and E7 or control retrovirus. Gene array analysis, RT-PCR, ELISAs and Western blotting showed that in cells expressing HPV 16 E6 and E7, expression levels of two potent angiogenesis inhibitors, thrombospondin-1 and maspin, were lower compared to controls. Additionally, major angiogenesis inducers, interleukin-8 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), were increased relative to controls. VEGF can be produced as multiple splice variants, all of which are required for the formation of patent blood vessels. The expression of HPV 16 E6 and E7 in keratinocytes augmented expression of VEGF 121, 145, 165 and 189. These observations show that HPV 16 E6 and E7 alter the phenotype of primary keratinocytes, diminishing expression of inhibitors and increasing expression of inducers of angiogenesis. This altered phenotype may permit keratinocytes infected by HPV 16 to play a role in the progression of cancer by permitting tumors to acquire a blood supply permissive of growth and spread.},

abstract = {High-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) infect stratified epithelia to establish persistent infections that maintain low-copy-number episomes in infected basal cells. Amplification of viral genomes occurs upon keratinocyte differentiation, followed by virion synthesis. During persistent HPV infections, viral proteins act to evade surveillance by both innate and adaptive immune responses. One of the primary pathways regulating the innate immune response is the JAK/STAT pathway. Our studies indicate that the expression of STAT-1, but not other members of interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF-3) complex such as STAT-2 and IFN regulatory factor 9 (IRF9), is selectively suppressed by HPV proteins at the level of transcription. Both E6 and E7 oncoproteins independently suppress the expression of STAT-1, and mutational analyses indicate that the E6 targeting E6-associated protein (E6AP) is responsible for suppression. The levels of STAT-1 proteins increase upon differentiation of both normal and HPV-positive cells but are still significantly reduced in the latter cells. Transient restoration of STAT-1 levels in HPV-positive cells using recombinant retroviruses significantly impaired viral amplification upon differentiation while long-term increases abrogated maintenance of episomes. Similarly, increased levels of STAT-1 induced by gamma interferon treatment inhibited HPV genome amplification upon differentiation. Overall, our findings demonstrate that suppression of STAT-1 expression by HPV proteins is necessary for genome amplification and maintenance of episomes, suggesting an important role for this activity in viral pathogenesis.},

abstract = {The hallmarks of cancer comprise six biological capabilities acquired during the multistep development of human tumors. The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list-reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the "tumor microenvironment." Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer.},

abstract = {Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) E5 protein, along with the more publicized E6 and E7 proteins of this virus, has been found to be oncogenic. E5 is a highly hydrophobic membrane-bound protein of 83 amino acids associated with the Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum, and nuclear membrane in infected cells. E5 can activate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) through binding to the 16 kD subunit of protein pump ATPase leading to a reduced downregulation of EGFR receptors. The activation of EGFR can initiate biochemical cascades that lead to overexpression of a variety of protooncogenes and stimulate rapid cell growth. Moreover, E5 can inhibit the expression of tumor suppressor gene p21((WafI/SdiI/CipI)) and impair the control of cell cycle checkpoint. E5 protein has been identified as a potential tumor vaccine target antigen.},

abstract = {Oncogenic types of human papillomaviruses (HPVs) cause cervical cancer in humans. The antiapoptotic viral E6 gene has been identified as a key factor for maintaining the viability of HPV-positive cancer cells. Although E6 has the potential to modulate many apoptosis regulators, the crucial apoptotic pathway blocked by endogenous E6 in cervical cancer cells remained unknown. Using RNA interference (RNAi), here, we show that targeted inhibition of E6 expression in cervical cancer cells leads to the transcriptional stimulation of the PUMA promoter, in a p53-dependent manner. This is linked to the activation and translocation of Bax to the mitochondrial membrane, cytochrome c release into the cytosol, and activation of caspase-3, in a PUMA-dependent manner. Moreover, inhibition of Bax expression by RNAi efficiently reverts the apoptotic phenotype, which results from inhibition of E6 expression. Thus, interference with the p53/PUMA/Bax cascade is crucial for the antiapoptotic function of the viral E6 oncogene in HPV-positive cancer cells.},

In cervical carcinogenesis, HPV proteins seem to interact with both miR-34a and miR-125b changing its expression and promoting persistent infection and cervical cancer development. In this review we describe the potential role of miR-125b and miR-34a in cervical carcinogenesis, including interaction with HPV and mechanism of deregulation.

abstract = {High-risk HPV-associated anal neoplasms are difficult to treat and biomarkers of malignant progression are needed. A hallmark of carcinogenic progression is genomic instability, which is frequently associated with cell division errors and aneuploidy. The HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein has been previously shown to rapidly induce centriole and centrosome overduplication and to cooperate with HPV-16 E6 in the induction of abnormal multipolar mitoses. Based on this function, it has been suggested that HPV-16 E7 may act as a driving force for chromosomal instability. However, a detailed analysis of centrosome overduplication in primary HPV-associated neoplasms has not been performed so far. Here, we determined the frequency of centrosome overduplication in HPV-associated anal lesions using a recently identified marker for mature maternal centrioles, Cep170. We detected centrosome overduplication in a small but significant fraction of cells. Remarkably, centrosome overduplication, but not aberrant centrosome numbers per se or centrosome accumulation, correlated significantly with the presence of cell division errors. In addition, our experiments revealed that in particular pseudo-bipolar mitoses may play a role in the propagation of chromosomal instability in high-risk HPV-associated tumors. These results provide new insights into the role of centrosome aberrations in cell division errors and encourage further studies on centrosome overduplication as a predictive biomarker of malignant progression in HPV-associated anal lesions.},

With an enviable capacity to adapt to continually changing environments, cancer represents the epitome of functional chaos, a stark contrast to the hierarchical and organized differentiation processes that dictate the development and life of biological organisms. The consequences of changing landscapes such as hypoxia and acidic extracellular pH in and around tumors create a cascade of changes in multiple pathways and networks that become apparent only several years later as recurrence and metastasis. These molecular and phenotypic changes, several of which are mediated by COX-2, approach the complexities of a "Gordian Knot." We review evidence from our studies and from literature suggesting that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) biology presents a nodal point in cancer biology and an "Achilles heel" of COX-2-dependent tumors.},

Interferon-alpha (IFNalpha) is used in the treatment of HPV infections yet both in vivo and in vitro data suggest that the virus has developed mechanisms to avoid the effects of interferon. Here we show that the HPV16 E7 oncoprotein is able to inhibit the induction of IFNalpha-inducible genes but has no effect of IFNgamma-inducible genes. Expression of E7 correlates with the loss of formation of the interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) transcription complex. Moreover, in the presence of E7, p48, the DNA-binding component of ISGF3, was unable to translocate to the nucleus upon IFNalpha stimulation. A direct protein-protein interaction was identified between E7 and p48 with the site of interaction within E7 defined as the region between amino acids 17-37, a domain that includes the binding site for the retinoblastoma protein, pRb. These results suggest that HPV, via E7, targets p48, resulting in the loss of IFNalpha-mediated signal transduction and may provide a means by which HPV can avoid the innate immune system.},

M2-PK occurs in a tetrameric form with a high affinity to its substrate phosphoenolpyruvate and a dimeric form with a low affinity to phosphoenolpyruvate, and the transition between both conformations regulates the glycolytic flux in tumor cells. The glycolytic intermediate fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate induces the reassociation of the dimeric to the tetrameric form of M2-PK. The expression of E7 in an experimental cell line shifts the equilibrium to the dimeric state despite a significant increase in the fructose 1,6-bisphosphate levels. Investigations of HPV-16 E7 mutants and the nononcogenic HPV-11 subtype suggest that the interaction of HPV-16 E7 with M2-PK may be linked to the transforming potential of the viral oncoprotein.},

Expression of HPV16 E7 in normal human epithelial cells caused increased levels of vimentin and fibronectin, whereas the epithelial adhesion protein E-cadherin was expressed at decreased levels. Similar expression patterns of vimentin, fibronectin and E-cadherin were also detected in cells expressing HPV16 E6 and E7 or the entire HPV16 early transcriptional unit. HPV16 E6 and E7 were each able to induce N-cadherin expression. Interestingly, these changes in expression levels of EMT-associated proteins are not similarly reflected at the level of mRNA expression, suggesting that HPV16 oncoproteins also modulate EMT through non-transcriptional mechanisms.

abstract = {Overcoming senescence signals in somatic cells is critical to cellular immortalization and carcinogenesis. High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) can immortalize epithelial cells in culture through degradation of the retinoblastoma protein by HPV E7 and activation of hTERT transcription, the catalytic subunit of telomerase, by the heterodimer HPV E6/E6-associated protein (E6AP). Recent work in our laboratory identified a novel repressor of hTERT transcription, NFX1-91, which is targeted for ubiquitin-mediated degradation by HPV type 16 (HPV16) E6/E6AP. In contrast, NFX1-123, a splice variant NFX1, increased expression from an hTERT promoter that was activated by HPV16 E6/E6AP. Here, we show that HPV16 E6 bound both NFX1-91 and NFX1-123 through the common central domain of NFX1 in the absence of E6AP. NFX1-123 positively regulated hTERT expression, as its knockdown decreased hTERT mRNA levels and telomerase activity and its overexpression increased telomerase activity. We identified new protein partners of NFX1-123, including several cytoplasmic poly(A) binding proteins (PABPCs) that interacted with NFX1-123 through its N-terminal PAM2 motif, a protein domain characteristic of other PABPC protein partners. Furthermore, NFX1-123 and PABPCs together had a synergistic stimulatory effect on hTERT-regulated reporter assays. The data suggest that NFX1-123 is integral to hTERT regulation in HPV16 E6-expressing epithelial cells and that the interaction between NFX1-123 and PABPCs is critical to hTERT activity.},

abstract = {The E5 proteins of human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are small hydrophobic proteins that are expressed in the early and late stages of the viral life cycle; however, their role in HPV pathogenesis is not clearly understood. In this study, a split-ubiquitin yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) two-hybrid system was used to identify B-cell-associated protein 31 (Bap31) as a binding partner of HPV E5 proteins. The association of these proteins was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation of complexes of Bap31 with either HPV type 16 (HPV16) or HPV31 E5. In addition, Bap31 and E5 were found to colocalize in perinuclear patterns consistent with localization to the endoplasmic reticulum. Mutational analysis of E5 identified amino acids in the extreme C terminus as important for stabilizing the interaction with Bap31. Deletion of these C-terminal amino acids of E5 in the context of complete HPV31 genomes resulted in impaired proliferative capacity of HPV-positive keratinocytes following differentiation. When small interfering RNAs were used to reduce the levels of Bap31, the proliferative ability of HPV-positive keratinocytes upon differentiation was also reduced, implicating Bap31 as a regulator of this process. These studies identify a novel binding partner of the high-risk HPV E5 proteins and provide insight into how the E5 proteins may modulate the life cycle in differentiating cells.},

abstract = {Although human papillomavirus (HPV) has been defined as the pathogen for cervical carcinomas, molecular events underlying the oncogenic process are unclear. As telomere dysfunction-mediated chromosomal instability and telomerase activation have been suggested as key events in carcinogenesis, we dissected the dynamic changes in telomere length, checkpoint response, and temporal profile of telomerase expression during the evolution from precursor lesions (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, CINs) to invasive cancers of the uterine cervix in sequential samples from 16 patients. Telomeres were significantly shortened in all CIN samples and no further substantial attritions occurred in most cases with the acquisition of malignant phenotype. Very short telomeres were coupled with constitutive activation of the DNA damage response pathway (Chk2 phosphorylation) and increased cellular proliferation in those cervical specimens. Telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) expression was preferably induced at advanced CINs or invasive cancers. The present finding demonstrates that excessive telomere shortening predominantly occurs in the early carcinogenesis of the uterine cervix largely prior to telomerase activation. Widespread over-erosion of telomeres or telomere dysfunction in very early stages of cervical tumorigenesis might fuel transformation processes by driving chromosomal instability.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Human papillomavirus (HPV)-16 oncoproteins, E6 and E7, are associated with enhanced tumor angiogenesis in human cervical cancers. The purpose of this study was (a) to investigate whether expression of HPV-16 E6 and E7 oncoproteins induces hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) and vascular endothelial growth factor expression in cervical cancer cells; and (b) to assess the effect of resveratrol on 16 E6- and E7-induced HIF-1 alpha and VEGF gene expression.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Human cervical cancer cell lines C-33A and HeLa were transiently cotransfected with pSG5-HPV-16 E6 or 16 E7 constructs along with HIF-1 alpha small interfering RNA (siRNA) or nonspecific siRNA. The expression of HIF-1 alpha/VEGF was measured using real-time PCR, Western blot analysis, or ELISA. The in vitro angiogenic activity induced by 16 E6- and E7-transfected cells was examined. The effect of resveratrol on oncoprotein-induced HIF-1 alpha/VEGF expression and in vitro angiogenesis was investigated.

RESULTS: HPV-16 E6- and E7-transfected cervical cancer cells express increased HIF-1 alpha protein and VEGF expression. These stimulatory effects were abrogated by cotransfection with either HIF-1 alpha siRNA or treatment with resveratrol. Blocking extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2) and phosphoinositide-3-kinase by PD98059 and LY294002, respectively, abolished 16 E6- and E7-induced HIF-1 alpha and VEGF expression. Functionally, we showed that HPV-16 E6- and E7-transfected cervical cancer cells stimulated in vitro capillary or tubule formation, and these angiogenic effects could be abolished either by cotransfection with HIF-1 alpha siRNA or by treatment with resveratrol.

CONCLUSION: HPV-16 oncoproteins contribute to enhanced angiogenesis in cervical cancer cells via HIF-1 alpha-dependent VEGF expression. Resveratrol suppresses 16 E6- and E7-induced HIF-1 alpha-mediated angiogenic activity and, thus, is a promising chemotherapeutic agent for human cervical cancer.},

abstract = {To investigate E7-dependent biochemical changes which are involved in cellular transformation, we analyzed the influence of human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) E7 on the expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins. Expression of E7 in established rodent fibroblasts (NIH 3T3), which was shown to be sufficient for transformation of these cells, leads to constitutive expression of the cyclin E and cyclin A genes in the absence of external growth factors. Surprisingly, expression of the cyclin D1 gene, which encodes a major regulator of G1 progression, is unaltered in E7-transformed cells. In transient transfection experiments, the cyclin A gene promoter is activated by E7 via an E2F binding site. In 14/2 cells, which were used as a model system to analyze the role of HPV-16 E7 in the transformation of primary cells, we observed rapid E7-dependent activation of cyclin E gene expression, which can be uncoupled from activation of the cyclin A gene, since the latter requires additional protein synthesis. E7-driven induction of cyclin E and cyclin A gene expression was accompanied by an increase in the associated kinase activities. Two domains of the E7 oncoprotein, which are designated cd1 and cd2, are essential for transformation of rodent fibroblasts. It is shown here that growth factor-independent expression of the cyclin E gene requires cd2 but not cd1, while activation of cyclin A gene expression requires cd1 function in addition to that of cd2. These data suggest that cyclin A gene expression is controlled by two distinct negative signals, one of which also restricts expression of the cyclin E gene. The ability of E7 to separately override each of these inhibitory signals, via cd1 and cd2, cosegregates with its ability to fully transform rodent fibroblasts. Unlike serum growth factors, E7 induces S-phase entry without activating cyclin D1 gene expression, in keeping with the finding that cyclin D1 function is not required in cells transformed by DNA tumor viruses.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The subpopulations and functions of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) from cervical cancer (CC) are altered. Dysfunction of TIL could be partially because of the inhibition by regulatory T (T(reg)) cells. FOXP3 is the control gene for the T(reg) cells.

METHODS: We investigated the distribution of TILs and FOXP3(+) cells in CC (n = 10) and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (n = 8) tissues. Double-immunofluorescence and confocal-based image quantitative microscopic analysis were used to calculate the number of cluster of differentiation (CD)4(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(+) T(reg) cells around the tumor cells.

RESULTS: The CD4(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(+) phenotype of T(reg) cells was accumulated around the tumor cells. CC contains a significantly higher proportion of the FOXP3(+) T cells than in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (p {\textless} 0.001). Moreover, CC with lymph node metastasis has a higher proportion of the FOXP3(+) T cells than that without lymph node metastasis (p {\textless} 0.05).

CONCLUSION: The increased accumulation of T(reg) cells suggests that T(reg) cells are important in the immunopathogenesis of CC.},

Persistent infection with oncogenic subtypes of the human papillomavirus (HPV) results in carcinogenesis, predominantly occurring at the cervical transformation zone where endocervical columnar cells undergo metaplasia to a stratified squamous epithelium. The molecular cascade involving viral oncoproteins, E6 and E7 and their degradative interactions with cellular tumor suppressor gene products, p53 and pRb respectively, has been precisely delineated. The precursor state of cervical neoplasia may last for years allowing for ready detection through successful screening programs in developed countries using cervical cytology and/or high risk HPV DNA testing. Prophylactic HPV L1 capsid protein vaccines using virus-like-particle technology have been developed to prevent primary infection by the most common high risk HPVs (16 and 18). Women who lack access to healthcare and for those who undergo sporadic screening remain at risk. Although radical surgery (including fertility-sparing surgery) is available for patients with early stage cancers, and chemoradiation plus high-dose-rate brachytherapy can cure the majority of those with locally advanced disease, patients with metastatic and non-operable recurrent cervical cancer constitute a high risk population with an unmet clinical need.

This results not only in aberrant proliferation but also in host cellular changes that can promote genomic instability. The HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein was found to induce centrosome abnormalities thereby disrupting mitotic fidelity and increasing the risk for chromosome missegregation and aneuploidy. In addition, expression of the high-risk HPV E7 oncoprotein stimulates DNA replication stress as a potential source of DNA breakage and structural chromosomal instability. Proliferation of genomically unstable cells is sustained by several mechanisms including the accelerated degradation of claspin by HPV-16 E7 and the degradation of p53 by the high-risk HPV E6 oncoprotein. These results highlight the oncogenic potential of aberrant proliferation and opens new avenues for prevention of malignant progression, not only in HPV-associated cervical cancer but also in non-virally associated malignancies with disrupted cell cycle checkpoint control mechanisms.},

Cloned neomycin-resistant cell lines were isolated and examined by cell culture on raised collagen rafts. Cell lines containing HPV-16 DNA retained the ability to stratify and express differentiation-specific keratins in the raft system but otherwise failed to differentiate normally. The histological abnormalities induced by HPV-16 closely resembled those seen in genital intraepithelial neoplasia in vivo. Hence, our results support the role of HPV-16 as an etiologic agent in the development of genital neoplasias and suggest a specific system for the study of HPV-16-induced epithelial cancers.},

abstract = {The adenovirus E1A gene product, the simian virus 40 large tumor antigen, and the human papillomavirus E7 protein share a short amino acid sequence that constitutes a domain required for the transforming activity of these proteins. These sequences are also required for these proteins to bind to the retinoblastoma gene product (pRb). Recent experiments have shown that E1A can dissociate complexes containing the transcription factor E2F bound to pRb, dependent on this conserved sequence element. We now show that the E7 protein and the simian virus 40 large tumor antigen can dissociate the E2F-pRb complex, dependent on this conserved sequence element. We also find that the E2F-pRb complex is absent in various human cervical carcinoma cell lines that either express the E7 protein or harbor an RB1 mutation, suggesting that the loss of the E2F-pRb interaction may be an important aspect in human cervical carcinogenesis. We suggest that the ability of E1A, the simian virus 40 large tumor antigen, and E7 to dissociate the E2F-pRb complex may be a common activity of these viral proteins that has evolved to stimulate quiescent cells into a proliferating state so that viral replication can proceed efficiently. In circumstances in which a lytic infection does not proceed, the consequence of this action may be to initiate the oncogenic process in a manner analogous to the mutation of the RB1 gene.},

abstract = {Human papillomavirus (HPV) types from the beta genus (beta-HPVs) have been implicated in the development of skin cancer. A potentially important aspect of their carcinogenic role is the ability of the E6 protein to degrade the proapoptotic family member Bak, which gives cells the ability to survive UV damage. However, it is unknown if the ability to degrade Bak is limited to certain beta-HPV types or whether E6 expression in keratinocytes affects other proteins important for apoptosis signaling. We tested the abilities of E6 proteins from several representative members of the beta-HPVs to degrade Bak and protect UV-treated keratinocytes from apoptosis. The E6 proteins of the beta-HPV type 5 (HPV5), -8, -20, -22, -38, -76, -92, and -96, as well as the alpha genus HPV HPV16, all degraded Bak or prevented its accumulation following UV treatment but did not degrade Bak constitutively. In addition, when tested using HPV16 E6 (16E6) and 8E6 as representative E6 proteins from the alpha and beta genera, respectively, Bak degradation was dependent on the E3 ubiquitin ligase, E6AP. Other important regulators of apoptotic signaling were examined and found to be unperturbed by the expression of the beta-HPV E6 proteins. Importantly, the expression of beta-HPV E6 proteins protected keratinocytes from apoptosis to the same extent as 16E6-expressing cells. In conclusion, several of the beta-HPV types possess the ability to protect UV-treated keratinocytes from apoptosis by reducing levels of Bak in those cells, thus blocking the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.},

abstract = {Cdc25A is a tyrosine phosphatase that is involved in the regulation of the G1/S phase transition by activating cyclin E/Cdk2 and cyclin A/Cdk2 complexes through removal of inhibitory phosphorylations. The E6 and E7 oncoproteins of the high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV) interact with and functionally abrogate the p53 and pRB proteins, respectively. In the present study we have investigated the regulation of the Cdc25A promoter during G1 and S-phases of the cell cycle and by the HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein. Serum induction leads to a derepression of the Cdc25A promoter and can be mediated through two E2F binding sites, E2F-A and E2F-C. While E2F-A is by both E2F1 and E2F4, E2F-C is regulated only by E2F1. The Cdc25A promoter is transactivated by the E7 oncogene of HPV-16. Furthermore, Cdc25A levels are highly increased in E7-expressing cell lines. Inducible expression of E7 leads to an immediate increase in Cdc25A protein levels. These data suggest that Cdc25A may be a critical target of HPV-16 E7 in the disruption of the G1/S phase transition.},

Overlapping binding sites for the cellular transcription factors Sp1 and E2F were identified in both promoters, and we found that E2F-mediated activation of transcription is inhibited by Sp1 in cotransfection experiments. The E2F/Sp1 binding sites contribute to transcriptional activation by E7, and the data suggest that the cyclin E gene is rendered E7-inducible through the combination of several cis-acting elements which display only weak intrinsic responsiveness to E7.},

abstract = {The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase acts as a cellular rheostat that integrates signals from a variety of cellular signal transduction pathways that sense growth factor and nutrient availability as well as intracellular energy status. It was previously reported that the human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) E6 oncoprotein may activate the S6 protein kinase (S6K) through binding and E6AP-mediated degradation of the mTOR inhibitor tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) (Z. Lu, X. Hu, Y. Li, L. Zheng, Y. Zhou, H. Jiang, T. Ning, Z. Basang, C. Zhang, and Y. Ke, J. Biol. Chem. 279:35664-35670, 2004; L. Zheng, H. Ding, Z. Lu, Y. Li, Y. Pan, T. Ning, and Y. Ke, Genes Cells 13:285-294, 2008). Our results confirmed that HPV16 E6 expression causes an increase in mTORC1 activity through enhanced phosphorylation of mTOR and activation of downstream signaling pathways S6K and eukaryotic initiation factor binding protein 1 (4E-BP1). However, we did not detect a decrease in TSC2 levels in HPV16 E6-expressing cells. We discovered, however, that HPV16 E6 expression causes AKT activation through the upstream kinases PDK1 and mTORC2 under conditions of nutrient deprivation. We show that HPV16 E6 expression causes an increase in protein synthesis by enhancing translation initiation complex assembly at the 5' mRNA cap and an increase in cap-dependent translation. The increase in cap-dependent translation likely results from HPV16 E6-induced AKT/mTORC1 activation, as the assembly of the translation initiation complex and cap-dependent translation are rapamycin sensitive. Lastly, coexpression of the HPV16 E6 and E7 oncoproteins does not affect HPV16 E6-induced activation of mTORC1 and cap-dependent translation. HPV16 E6-mediated activation of mTORC1 signaling and cap-dependent translation may be a mechanism to promote viral replication under conditions of limited nutrient supply in differentiated, HPV oncoprotein-expressing proliferating cells.},

abstract = {Cyclooxygenase (COX-2) is overexpressed in human papillomavirus (HPV)-induced diseases, including cervical cancer. Although HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins have been causally linked to cervical carcinogenesis, their effects on COX-2 gene expression are unknown. Increased levels of COX-2 mRNA, protein, and prostaglandin E(2) synthesis were detected in HPV16 E6- and E7-expressing cervical cancer cells (CaSki and SiHa) compared with an uninfected cervical cancer cell line (C33A). HPV16 E6 and E7 oncoproteins induced COX-2 transcription by activating the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)--{\textgreater}Ras--{\textgreater}mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Interestingly, HPV16 oncoproteins stimulated EGFR signaling, in part, by inducing the release of amphiregulin, an EGFR ligand. The inductive effects of HPV16 E6 and E7 were mediated by enhanced binding of activator protein-1 to the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-responsive element (-59/-53) of the COX-2 promoter. The potential contribution of coactivators and corepressors to HPV16 E6- and E7-mediated induction of COX-2 was also investigated. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that E6 and E7 oncoproteins induced the recruitment of phosphorylated c-Jun, c-Fos, UbcH5, and cAMP-responsive element binding protein-binding protein/p300 to the COX-2 promoter. In contrast, E6 and E7 inhibited the binding of the histone deacetylase 3-nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR) complex to the COX-2 promoter. Moreover, overexpression of NCoR blocked E6- and E7-mediated stimulation of the COX-2 promoter. Taken together, these results indicate that HPV16 E6 and E7 oncoproteins stimulated COX-2 transcription by inducing a corepressor/coactivator exchange. To our knowledge, this study also provides the first evidence that NCoR can function as a repressor of COX-2 gene expression.},

Angiogenesis begins early in the progression of cervical disease from mild to severe dysplasia and on to invasive cancer. We have previously reported that expression of human papillomavirus type 16 E6 and E7 (HPV16 E6E7) proteins in primary foreskin keratinocytes (HFKs) decreases expression of two inhibitors and increases expression of two angiogenic inducers [Toussaint-Smith, E., Donner, D.B., Roman, A., 2004. Expression of human papillomavirus type 16 E6 and E7 oncoproteins in primary foreskin keratinocytes is sufficient to alter the expression of angiogenic factors. Oncogene 23, 2988-2995]. Here we report that HPV-induced early changes in the keratinocyte phenotype are sufficient to alter endothelial cell behavior both in vitro and in vivo. Conditioned media from HPV16 E6E7 expressing HFKs as well as from human cervical keratinocytes containing the intact HPV16 were able to stimulate proliferation and migration of human microvascular endothelial cells. In addition, introduction of the conditioned media into immunocompetent mice using a Matrigel plug model resulted in a clear angiogenic response. These novel data support the hypothesis that HPV proteins contribute not only to the uncontrolled keratinocyte growth seen following HPV infection but also to the angiogenic response needed for tumor formation.},

Besides this transcription factor, essential in regulating inflammation and cancer development, an inflammatory microenvironment inhabiting various inflammatory cells and a network of signaling molecules are also indispensable for the malignant progression of transformed cells, which is attributed to the mutagenic predisposition of persistent infection-fighting agents at sites of chronic inflammation. As a subverted host response to inflammation-induced tumors, the inflammatory cells and regulators may facilitate angiogenesis and promote the growth, invasion, and metastasis of tumor cells. Thus far, research regarding inflammation-associated cancer development has focused on cytokines and chemokines as well as their downstream targets in linking inflammation and cancer. Moreover, other proteins with extensive roles in inflammation and cancer, such as signal transducers and activators of transcription, Nrf2, and nuclear factor of activated T cells, are also proposed to be promising targets for future studies. The elucidation of their specific effects and interactions will accelerate the development of novel therapeutic interventions against cancer development triggered by inflammation.},

In the present study, the effect of E6 on Bax mRNA expression and protein stability was investigated. These studies indicate that stable E6 expression in differentiating keratinocytes reduced the steady-state levels of Bax mRNA and shortened the half-life of Bax protein. These results were confirmed in transiently transfected 293T cells where E6 degraded Bax in a dose-dependent manner. Bax degradation was also exhibited in Saos-2 cells that lack p53, indicating its p53 independence. E6 did not form complexes with Bax and did not induce Bax degradation in vitro under experimental conditions where p53 was degraded. Finally, E6 aa 120-132 were shown to be necessary for Bax destabilization and, more importantly, for abrogating the ability of Bax to induce cellular apoptosis, highlighting the functional consequences of the E6-induced alterations in Bax expression.},

abstract = {The high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 proteins are consistently expressed in HPV-associated lesions and cancers. HPV16 E6 sustains the activity of the mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling cascades under conditions of growth factor deprivation. Here we report that HPV16 E6 activated mTORC1 by enhanced signaling through receptor protein tyrosine kinases, including epidermal growth factor receptor and insulin receptor and insulin-like growth factor receptors. This is evidenced by sustained signaling through these receptors for several hours after growth factor withdrawal. HPV16 E6 increased the internalization of activated receptor species, and the signaling adaptor protein GRB2 was shown to be critical for HPV16 E6 mediated enhanced EGFR internalization and mTORC1 activation. As a consequence of receptor protein kinase mediated mTORC1 activation, HPV16 E6 expression increased cellular migration of primary human epithelial cells. This study identifies a previously unappreciated mechanism by which HPV E6 proteins perturb host-signaling pathways presumably to sustain protein synthesis during the viral life cycle that may also contribute to cellular transforming activities of high-risk HPV E6 proteins.},

The E7 proteins of these different HPVs were assessed for their ability to form complexes with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene product (p105-RB). Similar to the E7 protein of HPV-16, the E7 proteins of HPV-18, HBV-6b and HPV-11 were found to associate with p105-RB in vitro. The E7 proteins of HPV types associated with a high risk of malignant progression (HPV-16 and HPV-18) formed complexes with p105-RB with equal affinities. The E7 proteins encoded by HPV types 6b and 11, which are associated with clinical lesions with a lower risk for progression, bound to p105-RB with lower affinities. The E7 protein of the bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1), which does not share structural similarity in the amino terminal region with the HPV E7 proteins, was unable to form a detectable complex with p105-RB. The amino acid sequences of the HPV-16 E7 protein involved in complex formation with p105-RB in vitro have been mapped. Only a portion of the sequences that are conserved between the HPV E7 proteins and AdE1A were necessary for association with p105-RB. Furthermore, the HPV-16 E7-p105-RB complex was detected in an HPV-16-transformed human keratinocyte cell line.},

abstract = {HPV-16 is the major causes of cervical cancer. Persistence of infection is a necessary event for progression of the infection to cancer. Among other factors, virus persistence is due the viral proteins fighting the immune response. HPV-16 E5 down-regulates MHC/HLA class I, which is much reduced on the cell surface and accumulates in the Golgi apparatus in cells expressing E5. This effect is observed also in W12 cells, which mimic early cervical intraepithelial progression to cervical cancer. The functional effect of MHC I down-regulation on human CD8 T cells is not known, because of the need for HLA-matched, HPV-specific T cells that recognise E5 expressing-cells. Here we employ a heterologous cell/MHC I system which uses mouse cells expressing both E5 and HLA-A2, and A2-restricted CTLs; we show that the E5-induced reduction of HLA-A2 has a functional impact by reducing recognition of E5 expressing cells by HPV specific CD8+ T cells.},

abstract = {Interferons (IFNs) elicit multifaceted effects in host innate defence. Accumulating evidence revealed that not only the first identified Jak-Stat pathway but also other newly found signalling pathways are required for the induction of versatile responses by IFNs. In particular, type I IFNs are inducible by viral infection through the recognition of pathogen-associated molecules by pattern recognition receptors, and the induction of multiple IFN-stimulated genes through the activation of type I IFN signalling confers antiviral and immunomodulatory activities. Any step in this process is often targeted by viruses for their immuno-evasion. The regulatory function of constitutive IFN-alpha/beta signalling has been recognized in terms of its boosting effect on cellular responsiveness in host defence systems. Further comprehensive understanding of IFN signalling may offer a better direction to unravelling the complex signalling networks in the host defence system, and may contribute to their more effective therapeutic applications.},

abstract = {Human papillomavirus type 16 E5 protein (HPV-16 E5) is expressed early in papillomavirus infection and is localised primarily in the cell Golgi apparatus (GA) and endoplasmic reticulum. E5 prevents transport of the major histocompatibility class I (MHC I; HLA class I in humans) to the cell surface and retains the complex in the GA. We report that these effects are due, at least in part, to the interaction between E5 and HLA I heavy chain (HC). We also demonstrate that the down-regulation of surface HLA I and interaction with HC are mediated by the first hydrophobic domain of E5. Although E5 downregulates classical HLA selectively as it does not downregulate non-classical HLA, the interaction with the HC of classical HLA I is not specific for a particular haplotype of HLA I. This suggests that E5 can interfere with antigen presentation by most, if not all, classical HLA I haplotypes, with potentially serious consequences as the ability of infected cells to present antigenic peptides to effector T cells would be compromised.},

abstract = {Altered angiogenic response is associated with high-grade cervical dysplasia and with invasive squamous carcinoma of the cervix. Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is one of the most potent inducers of angiogenesis and is up-regulated in carcinoma of the cervix. Infection by high-risk human papillomavirus and persistent expression of viral oncogene E6 are etiologically linked to the development of cervical cancer. E6 is able to immortalize cells and induce malignant transformation by inactivating p53. In cervical cancer, regulation of VEGF expression is poorly described. Thus, we investigated whether E6 oncoprotein could regulate VEGF expression in HPV18-positive cervical cancer-derived HeLa cells harboring a wild-type p53. The alternative splicing of vegf mRNA renders three major isoforms of 121, 165 and 189 amino-acids in humans. We have designed isoform specific real time QRT-PCR assays to quantitate vegf transcripts and VEGF121 was the predominant isoform. Silencing HPV18 E6 mRNA with specific siRNA reduced VEGF121 expression by at least 50{\%} whereas silencing of p53 did not alter its expression. Treatment with cycloheximide did not inhibit E6-induced VEGF121 expression. Collectively, these results suggest that HPV18 E6 oncoprotein contributes to tumor angiogenesis by inducing VEGF transcription from the promoter in a p53-independent manner.},

Multiple transcription factors have been identified as being involved in E6-induced hTERT expression. Here, we adapted an unbiased in vivo screen using a LacO-LacI system in human cells to discover hTERT promoter-interacting regulators. This approach allowed us to identify a novel hTERT repressor, Maz, which bound the hTERT promoter. E6 expression reduced Maz binding and correspondingly increased Sp1 binding at the hTERT promoter. Knockdown of Maz further increased histone acetylation, as well as hTERT expression in the presence of E6. Overall, these data indicate the utility of a novel screen for promoter-interacting and transcription-regulating proteins. These data also highlight multiple factors that normally regulate hTERT repression in HFKs, and therefore are targeted by E6 for hTERT expression.},

Human viral oncogenesis is complex, and only a small percentage of the infected individuals develop cancer, often many years to decades after the initial infection. This reflects the multistep nature of viral oncogenesis, host genetic variability, and the fact that viruses contribute to only a portion of the oncogenic events. In this review, the Hallmarks of Cancer framework of Hanahan and Weinberg (2000 and 2011) is used to dissect the viral, host, and environmental cofactors that contribute to the biology of multistep oncogenesis mediated by established human oncoviruses. The viruses discussed include Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs), hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV, respectively), human T cell lymphotropic virus-1 (HTLV-1), and Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV).},

abstract = {Persistent infections with human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16), HPV18, or HPV31 are necessary for the development of cervical cancer, implying that HPVs have evolved immunoevasive mechanisms. Recent global transcriptome analyses indicated that these HPV types downregulate the constitutive expression of interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes (ISGs), but the underlying mechanism is not well understood. Comparative analyses of ISG transcription in keratinocytes with complete HPV16, -18, and -31 genomes revealed that antiviral genes (IFIT1 and MX1), genes involved in IFN signaling (STAT1), proapoptotic genes (TRAIL and XAF1), and pathogen recognition receptors (TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA5) are inhibited to similar extents by HPV16, -18, and -31. The lower expression of pathogen receptors in HPV-positive cells correlated with a greatly impaired induction of IFN-$\beta$ and also of IFN-$\lambda$1, -2, and -3 upon receptor stimulation. IFN-$\kappa$ is constitutively expressed in normal keratinocytes and is strongly repressed by HPV16, -18, and -31. ISGs downregulated in HPV-positive cells can be reactivated by IFN-$\kappa$ expression. The viral E6 and E7 oncogenes are sufficient for IFN-$\kappa$ repression, with E6 being mainly responsible. E6 inhibits IFN-$\kappa$ transcription independently from binding to PDZ proteins. IFN-$\kappa$ expression can be activated in only one cell line by E6AP knockdown but can be activated in all tested HPV-positive cells by addition of a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, suggesting that HPVs modulate DNA methylation. Taken together, these results suggest that carcinogenic HPVs target IFN-$\kappa$ by different pathways in keratinocytes to inhibit both antiviral ISGs and pathogen recognition receptors, which in turn reduces the expression of inducible IFNs.},

abstract = {Metabolic reprogramming and altered bioenergetics have become emerged as a hallmark of cancer and an area of active basic and translational cancer research. Drastically upregulated glucose transport and metabolism in most cancers regardless the oxygen supply, a phenomenon called the Warburg effect, is one of major focuses of the research. Warburg speculated that cancer cells, due to defective mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), switch to glycolysis for ATP synthesis, even in the presence of oxygen. Studies in the recent decade indicated that while glycolysis is indeed drastically upregulated in almost all cancer cells, mitochondrial respiration continues to operate normally at rates proportional to oxygen supply. There is no OXPHOS-to-glycolysis switch but rather upregulation of glycolysis. Furthermore, upregulated glycolysis appears to be for synthesis of biomass and reducing equivalents in addition to ATP production. The new finding that a significant amount of glycolytic intermediates are diverted to the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) for production of NADPH has profound implications in how cancer cells use the Warburg effect to cope with reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and oxidative stress, opening the door for anti-cancer interventions taking advantage of this. Recent findings in the Warburg effect and its relationship with ROS and oxidative stress controls will be reviewed. Cancer treatment strategies based on these new findings will be presented and discussed.},
