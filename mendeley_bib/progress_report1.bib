Such 'unpredictable' drug responses are particularly dangerous in the context of anticancer agents that have narrow therapeutic indices. Pharmacogenomics attempts to elucidate the inherited basis of interindividual differences in drug response, with the eventual goal of minimizing such variability through the use of 'individualized' treatments. There are several emerging examples of genetic polymorphisms of drug-metabolizing enzymes, DNA repair genes and drug targets that have been shown to influence the toxicity and efficacy of anticancer treatment.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sporadic colorectal cancers often arise from a region of cells characterized by a "field defect" that has not been well defined molecularly. DNA methylation has been proposed as a candidate mediator of this field defect. The DNA repair gene O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is frequently methylated in colorectal cancer. We hypothesized that MGMT methylation could be one of the mediators of field cancerization in the colon mucosa. METHODS: We studied MGMT promoter methylation by three different bisulfite-based techniques in tumor, adjacent mucosa, and non-adjacent mucosa from 95 colorectal cancer patients and in colon mucosa from 33 subjects with no evidence of cancer. Statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: MGMT promoter methylation was present in 46{\%} of the tumors. Patients whose cancer had MGMT promoter methylation also had substantial MGMT promoter methylation in apparently normal adjacent mucosa. This methylation was seen with a quantitative assay in 50{\%} (22/44; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 34{\%} to 65{\%}) of normal samples with MGMT promoter methylation in the adjacent tumors, 6{\%} (3/51; 95{\%} CI = 1{\%} to 16{\%}) of samples without MGMT methylation in adjacent tumors, and 12{\%} (4/33; 95{\%} CI = 3{\%} to 28{\%}) of control samples (P {\textless} .001 for comparison between each of the latter two groups and the first group). MGMT methylation was detected with a more sensitive assay in 94{\%}, 34{\%}, and 27{\%} of these samples, respectively (P {\textless} .001). In grossly normal colonic mucosa of colon cancer patients, methylation was detected 10 cm away from the tumor in 10 of 13 cases. Tumors with MGMT promoter methylation had a higher rate of G-to-A mutation in the KRAS oncogene than tumors without MGMT promoter methylation (10/42 versus 3/46, P = .03). Using a sensitive mutant allele-specific amplification assay for KRAS mutations, we also found KRAS mutations in 12{\%} (3/25; 95{\%} CI = 2.5{\%} to 31{\%}) of colorectal mucosas with detectable MGMT methylation and 3{\%} (2/64; 95{\%} CI = 0.4{\%} to 11{\%}) of colorectal mucosas without MGMT methylation (P = .13). CONCLUSION: Some colorectal cancers arise from a field defect defined by epigenetic inactivation of MGMT. Detection of this abnormality may ultimately be useful in risk assessment for colorectal cancer.},

abstract = {Approximately 12{\%} of all human cancers are caused by oncoviruses. Human viral oncogenesis is complex, and only a small percentage of the infected individuals develop cancer, often many years to decades after the initial infection. This reflects the multistep nature of viral oncogenesis, host genetic variability, and the fact that viruses contribute to only a portion of the oncogenic events. In this review, the Hallmarks of Cancer framework of Hanahan and Weinberg (2000 and 2011) is used to dissect the viral, host, and environmental cofactors that contribute to the biology of multistep oncogenesis mediated by established human oncoviruses. The viruses discussed include Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs), hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV, respectively), human T cell lymphotropic virus-1 (HTLV-1), and Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV).},

@article{Doorbar2006a,
abstract = {HPVs (human papillomaviruses) infect epithelial cells and cause a variety of lesions ranging from common warts/verrucas to cervical neoplasia and cancer. Over 100 different HPV types have been identified so far, with a subset of these being classified as high risk. High-risk HPV DNA is found in almost all cervical cancers ({\textgreater}99.7{\%}), with HPV16 being the most prevalent type in both low-grade disease and cervical neoplasia. Productive infection by high-risk HPV types is manifest as cervical flat warts or condyloma that shed infectious virions from their surface. Viral genomes are maintained as episomes in the basal layer, with viral gene expression being tightly controlled as the infected cells move towards the epithelial surface. The pattern of viral gene expression in low-grade cervical lesions resembles that seen in productive warts caused by other HPV types. High-grade neoplasia represents an abortive infection in which viral gene expression becomes deregulated, and the normal life cycle of the virus cannot be completed. Most cervical cancers arise within the cervical transformation zone at the squamous/columnar junction, and it has been suggested that this is a site where productive infection may be inefficiently supported. The high-risk E6 and E7 proteins drive cell proliferation through their association with PDZ domain proteins and Rb (retinoblastoma), and contribute to neoplastic progression, whereas E6-mediated p53 degradation prevents the normal repair of chance mutations in the cellular genome. Cancers usually arise in individuals who fail to resolve their infection and who retain oncogene expression for years or decades. In most individuals, immune regression eventually leads to clearance of the virus, or to its maintenance in a latent or asymptomatic state in the basal cells.},

abstract = {Cancer begins with multiple cumulative epigenetic and genetic alterations that sequencially transform a cell, or a group of cells in a particular organ. The early genetic events might lead to clonal expansion of pre-neoplastic daughter cells in a particular tumor field. Subsequent genomic changes in some of these cells drive them towards the malignant phenotype. These transformed cells are diagnosed histopathologically as cancers owing to changes in cell morphology. Conceivably, a population of daughter cells with early genetic changes (without histopathology) remain in the organ, demonstrating the concept of field cancerization. With present technological advancement, including laser capture microdisection and high-throughput genomic technologies, carefully designed studies using appropriate control tissue will enable identification of important molecular signatures in these genetically transformed but histologically normal cells. Such tumor-specific biomarkers should have excellent clinical utility.

abstract = {AIMS: Archival fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (PET) is a valuable source for population-based molecular genetic studies but the extraction of high quality DNA is still a problematic issue. The present study tested the grade of DNA fragmentation and the DNA adequacy for genetic investigations in a large series of tissue specimens that were formalin- or Bouin-fixed and paraffin-embedded between 1979 and 1983. Specific aims were to: (1) estimate the amount of archival tissue samples from which DNA is recoverable by conventional methods and the influence of variables (origin, fixative, section size) on DNA recovery; and (2) evaluate the feasibility of genetic investigations in large scale population studies. METHODS: DNA was extracted in 2005 from 365 PET samples from Italy and Spain and subjected to PCR analysis targeting fragments of 152, 268 and 676 bp of the beta-globin gene. RESULTS: Amplification of a 152 bp fragment was obtained in 252/365 (69{\%}) PET samples, a 268 bp fragment in 62/365 (17{\%}), a 676 bp fragment in 19/365 (5{\%}) and no amplification for any fragment was obtained in 113/365 (31{\%}). A second processing of newly cut sections performed in a 25{\%} simple random sample gave comparable results, with substantial concordance between the first and second tests (kappa value 0.62 [95{\%} CI 0.59-0.64]). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show that DNA can be efficiently extracted from PETs archived for more than 20 years, and that large scale population studies based on PCR amplification of short target sequences are feasible.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Paraffin-embedded tumor samples are valuable in the study of cancer for routine staging, tumor marker analysis, and in retrospective studies to test new prognostic and predictive biomarkers. Their utility in retrospective pharmacogenetic analysis of clinical trials has yet to be evaluated. We set out to establish genotyping methods for relevant genes from archival tumor samples and determine if fixation, processing or somatic changes in the tumor might affect our ability to identify germ-line polymorphisms. METHODS AND RESULTS: To establish the assays, paraffin blocks were made using pellets prepared from eight tumor cell lines. DNA was isolated from viable cells and from sections from these blocks, and genotyped for polymorphisms in CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A5 and MDR1 using conventional PCR-RFLP assays. This demonstrated that fixation and processing did not alter the genotypes obtained (100{\%} concordance). Next, sections were obtained from paraffin-embedded archival breast samples from 10 patients for whom gDNA isolated from peripheral blood was available for comparison. Concordance was complete with the same genotype being obtained for 100{\%} of the samples tested. Attempts to extend these methods for the study of hematoxylin/eosin or immunohistochemically stained sections were not successful since the staining inhibited the PCR reactions. Only 25 of 50 samples were successfully amplified and of those only 14 produced accurate genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Accurate genetic testing for polymorphisms in several genes of pharmacogenetic importance can be obtained from archival paraffin-embedded tumor samples.

abstract = {DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark that has suspected regulatory roles in a broad range of biological processes and diseases. The technology is now available for studying DNA methylation genome-wide, at a high resolution and in a large number of samples. This Review discusses relevant concepts, computational methods and software tools for analysing and interpreting DNA methylation data. It focuses not only on the bioinformatic challenges of large epigenome-mapping projects and epigenome-wide association studies but also highlights software tools that make genome-wide DNA methylation mapping more accessible for laboratories with limited bioinformatics experience.},

abstract = {Genomic instability is a hallmark of human cancers, including the 5{\%} caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). Here we report a striking association between HPV integration and adjacent host genomic structural variation in human cancer cell lines and primary tumors. Whole-genome sequencing revealed HPV integrants flanking and bridging extensive host genomic amplifications and rearrangements, including deletions, inversions, and chromosomal translocations. We present a model of "looping" by which HPV integrant-mediated DNA replication and recombination may result in viral-host DNA concatemers, frequently disrupting genes involved in oncogenesis and amplifying HPV oncogenes E6 and E7. Our high-resolution results shed new light on a catastrophic process, distinct from chromothripsis and other mutational processes, by which HPV directly promotes genomic instability.},

abstract = {Genomic analysis of archival tissues fixed in formalin is of fundamental importance in biomedical research, and numerous studies have used such material. Although the possibility of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-introduced artifacts is known, the use of direct sequencing has been thought to overcome such problems. Here we report the results from a controlled study, performed in parallel on frozen and formalin-fixed material, where a high frequency of nonreproducible sequence alterations was detected with the use of formalin-fixed tissues. Defined numbers of well-characterized tumor cells were amplified and analyzed by direct DNA sequencing. No nonreproducible sequence alterations were found in frozen tissues. In formalin-fixed material up to one mutation artifact per 500 bases was recorded. The chance of such artificial mutations in formalin-fixed material was inversely correlated with the number of cells used in the PCR-the fewer cells, the more artifacts. A total of 28 artificial mutations were recorded, of which 27 were C-T or G-A transitions. Through confirmational sequencing of independent amplification products artifacts can be distinguished from true mutations. However, because this problem was not acknowledged earlier, the presence of artifacts may have profoundly influenced previously reported mutations in formalin-fixed material, including those inserted into mutation databases.},

abstract = {Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may be associated with the response or toxicity to different types of treatment. Although SNP analysis is usually performed on DNA from peripheral blood, formalin fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue is often used for retrospective studies. We analyzed VEGF (-2578C{\textgreater}A, -1498C{\textgreater}T, -1154G{\textgreater}A, -634C{\textgreater}G, +936C{\textgreater}T) and eNOS (+894G{\textgreater}T, -786T{\textgreater}C, VNTR (variable number of tandem repeats) 27bp intron 4) polymorphisms by direct sequencing or Real Time PCR in 237 patients with advanced colorectal cancer. Peripheral blood was used for 153 patients, whereas only FFPE tumor tissue was available for 84 patients. All SNP frequencies were in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE), with the exception of VEGF -1154, which was only in HWE in peripheral blood specimens. We therefore analyzed this SNP in DNA extracted from FFPE tumor tissue compared to FFPE healthy tissue and peripheral blood from 20 patients. Numerous heterozygous patients in peripheral blood DNA were homozygous for the A-allele in both tumor and healthy FFPE tissues. Our findings indicate that, although FFPE tissue might be a suitable specimen for genotyping, VEGF -1154 does not give reliable results on this type of material. As other SNPs may also have this limitation, genotype concordance should first be confirmed by comparing results obtained from FFPE and fresh sample analyses.},

@article{Gilbert2007,
abstract = {Museums and pathology collections around the world represent an archive of genetic material to study populations and diseases. For preservation purposes, a large portion of these collections has been fixed in formalin-containing solutions, a treatment that results in cross-linking of biomolecules. Cross-linking not only complicates isolation of nucleic acid but also introduces polymerase "blocks" during PCR. A wide variety of methods exists for the recovery of DNA and RNA from archival tissues, and although a number of previous studies have qualitatively compared the relative merits of the different techniques, very few have undertaken wide scale quantitative comparisons. To help address this issue, we have undertaken a study that investigates the quality of nucleic acids recovered from a test panel of fixed specimens that have been manipulated following a number of the published protocols. These include methods of pre-treating the samples prior to extraction, extraction and nucleic acid purification methods themselves, and a post-extraction enzymatic repair technique. We find that although many of the published methods have distinct positive effects on some characteristics of the nucleic acids, the benefits often come at a cost. In addition, a number of the previously published techniques appear to have no effect at all. Our findings recommend that the extraction methodology adopted should be chosen carefully. Here we provide a quick reference table that can be used to determine appropriate protocols for particular aims.},
