\chapter{Acknowledgments}

Although this thesis only bears one name, its completion would be impossible without the contribution of many individuals. First and foremost, I would like to express my sincere gratitute to my supervisor, Dr. Aly Karsan, for the opportunity to work in his lab which consists of diverse talents as well as his patience, guidance, and extensive knowledge in clinical informatics. 

I would also like to thank my labmates from the bioinformatics team, Kieran and Rod, and members from the Centre of Clinical Genomics, Liz and Jill, for their insightful comments and help throughout my time in the lab. I would like to extend my gratitude to my supervisory committee members, Dr. Ryan Morin and Dr. Martin Hirst, for their knowledgeable feedback and continuous effort in asking me difficult questions which motivated me to widen my research from various perspectives. 

My sincere thanks also goes to my friends who supported me and lifted my spirits through the tough times. Last but not least, I would like to thank my family: mom and dad, for always encouraging my interest in science and listening to my endless science talks and my sisters, for believing in my ability even when I doubt myself. I am a lucky person.
