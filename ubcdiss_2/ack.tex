\chapter{Acknowledgments}

I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Aly Karsan for giving me the opportunity to undertake a bioinformatics project for my Master's thesis and funding me throughout the course of my research. My gratitude is extended to my committee members, Dr. Martin Hirst and Dr. Ryan Morin for providing guidance and ideas in data analyses for my project. I am also grateful for the productive discussions I had with my colleagues from the Centre for Clinical Genomics and Karsan lab.

There were many individuals who endured my frustration yet provided me with endless support and encouragement. For that, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to my family, my academic mentor, Dr. David Walker, and my friends. Thank you James Topham, Jenny Zhao, Jessica Pilsworth, Joey Ip, Kate Slowski, Ka Ming Nip, Laura Graziano, Patrick Coulombe, Samiah Alam, Samantha Jones, Santina Lin, Tehmina Masud, and Yuko Goto for keeping me motivated and sane throughout this journey. Last but not least, I would like to thank my partner, Florian Krauthan for comforting me in my moments of failures, celebrating my successes, and understanding why dirty dishes were left in the sink.
