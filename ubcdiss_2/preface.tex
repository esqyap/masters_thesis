\chapter{Preface}

This dissertation is based on next-generation sequencing data from The OncoPanel Pilot (TOP) study. The TOP study was designed to optimize and validate a clinical targeted NGS panel for its utility as standard of care. Approval of this pilot study was covered by the Human Research Ethics Protocol H14-01212. Sample preparation and sequencing, as well as processing of raw data, read alignment, and variant calling were performed by Canada's Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre and the Center for Clinical Genomics. Data analyses in Chapter 3 and 4 are my original work.

A version of the Introduction chapter was submitted to the Ideas, Numbers, and Knowledge (INK) journal. Analysis of pharmacogenomic genes in Chapter 3 and 4 was presented as a poster titled "Comparative Analysis of Pharmacogenomic Variants in Amplicon-sequenced DNA from Peripheral Blood and Formalin-fixed Paraffin-embedded Tumours" at the 2016 Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology conference and the Translational Medicine (TransMed) Special Interest Group meeting.
